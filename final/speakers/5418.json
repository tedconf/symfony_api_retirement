She is vice president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit combatting privacy-invading online abuse that undermines civil rights and civil liberties.<\/p><p>When Citron began addressing cyber harassment ten years ago, it was commonly believed that it was &quot;no big deal,&quot; and that any legal response would &quot;break the internet.&quot; Those attitudes -- and the heartbreaking stories of victims who were terrorized, silenced and economically damaged -- drove Citron to write her 2014 book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/K81JhDp\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hate Crimes in Cyberspace<\/em><\/a>. Ever&nbsp;since, she has been working with lawmakers, law enforcers, and tech companies to make online spaces and tools available to all on equal terms.
