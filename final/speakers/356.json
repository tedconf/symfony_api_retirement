","whylisten":"<p>When horrific climate-change scenarios elicit little but endless chatter from governments and entrenched special interests, the difference between talk and action represent an embarrassing gulf. Meet Shai Agassi, who has stepped fearlessly into that gap. His approach to <strong>solving the puzzle of electric automobiles<\/strong> could spark nothing short of an automotive revolution. <\/p><p>Agassi stunned the software industry in 2007 by resigning from SAP to focus on his vision for <strong>breaking the world&#39;s fossil-fuel habit<\/strong>, a cause he had championed since his fuse was lit at a Young Global Leaders conference in 2005. Through his enthusiastic persistence, Agassi&#39;s startup Better Place has signed up some impressive partners -- including Nissan-Renault and the countries of Israel and Denmark. <\/p>","slug":"shai_agassi","published_at":"2009-04-13 01:00:00","updated_at":"2013-07-24 18:46:24"}}
