Her research bridges computational models of cognitive development and behavioral studies in order to understand the origins of inquiry and discovery. <\/p>   <p> Working in play labs, children&rsquo;s museums, and a recently-launched citizen science website, Schultz is reshaping how we view young children&rsquo;s perceptions of the world around them.
