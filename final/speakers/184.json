Instead, he discovered the potter's wheel, and the transforming power of fountains, irrepressible dreams, and the slide show.","whylisten":"<p>Bill Strickland&#39;s journey from at-risk youth to 1996  MacArthur &quot;Genius&quot; grant recipient would be remarkable in itself, if it were not overshadowed by the staggering breadth of his vision. While moonlighting as an airline pilot, Strickland founded Manchester Bidwell, a world-class institute in his native Pittsburgh devoted to vocational instruction in partnership with big business -- and, almost incidentally, home to a Grammy-winning record label and a world-class jazz performance series. Yet its emphasis on the arts is no accident, as it embodies Strickland&#39;s conviction that an atmosphere of high culture and respect will energize even the most troubled students. <br \/><br \/>With job placement rates that rival most universities, Manchester Bidwell&#39;s success has attracted the attention of everyone from George Bush, Sr. (who appointed Strickland to a six-year term on the board of the NEA) to Fred Rogers (who invited Strickland to demonstrate pot throwing on <em>Mister Rogers&#39; Neighborhood<\/em>). In 2010, President Obama appointed Strickland to the White House Council  for Community Solutions, which oversees volunteering and community  service on a local and national level. And though cumbersome slide trays have been replaced by PowerPoint, the inspirational power of his speeches and slide shows are the stuff of lecture circuit legend.<\/p>","slug":"bill_strickland","published_at":"2008-01-20 23:07:00","updated_at":"2013-09-09 17:08:12"}}
