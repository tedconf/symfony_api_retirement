How? They kicked off the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge to honor 29-year-old Pete Frates.","whylisten":"        <p>When Nancy Frates&rsquo;&nbsp;son was diagnosed with ALS in 2012, she was confused. Pete was a 27-year-old athlete and the only people she&rsquo;d ever known with this disease were elderly already. Ever since that life-changing moment, she and her family have found their sense of purpose in working tirelessly to raise awareness about ALS and to stimulate funding for research. Because it&rsquo;s been 75 years since Lou Gehrig delivered his famed farewell speech, and no treatment or cure has been found. This, says Nancy Frates, is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>This July, Pete Frates inspired the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which quickly became a viral fundraising phenomenon. The challenge inspired people across the United States and world to dump a bucket of ice on their head and pass the challenge on to three friends. In all, The ALS Association projects that the challenge will have raised $160 million for research by the end of 2014.<\/p> <p>Pete Frates is now paralyzed and mute&mdash;he speaks to the world through eye gazer technology and through his family. They all remain hopeful for progress in treating this terrible disease.<\/p>","slug":"nancy_frates","published_at":"2014-11-19 15:19:00","updated_at":"2014-11-19 19:41:21"}}
