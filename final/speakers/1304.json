Then, in 2005, Italian engineer Massimo Banzi and his team created the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.arduino.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Arduino<\/a>&nbsp;microcontroller, a small, cheap programmable computer, bringing interactive technology to the masses.<\/p><p>With a variety of sensors, the Arduino is versatile and easy to use. Since its inception, the device has popped up in projects as varied as an exhibit on brains at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, to a DIY kit that sends a Tweet when your houseplant needs water.<\/p>","slug":"massimo_banzi","published_at":"2012-04-27 01:21:00","updated_at":"2012-06-27 13:44:15"}}
