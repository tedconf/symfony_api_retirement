He's dug up dinosaurs on five continents -- and discovered the world's largest crocodile, the (extinct) 40-foot <i>Sarchosuchus<\/i>.","whylisten":"<p>Paul Sereno sees paleontology as &quot;<strong>adventure with a purpose<\/strong>.&quot; How else, after all, to describe a science that &quot;allows you to romp                            in remote corners of the globe, resurrecting gargantuan                            creatures that have never been seen?&quot; His travels in the search for the bones of ancient reptiles and birds have taken him through India, Argentina, Mongolia and, most fruitfully, the 125-degrees-Farenheit Saraha Desert, where he uncovered the giant skeletons of several 30-plus-foot meat-eaters and a few yet-larger prehistoric vegetarians. <\/p><p>Sereno is also president and co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectexploration.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Exploration<\/a>, an organization which aims to <strong>bring the wonders of science professions to the public -- especially minority youth and girls<\/strong>.
