Her own life colors her work: after briefly          studying art at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Lyon, and Mandarin Chinese          at the Universit&eacute; of Lyon III, Coron experienced life with a series          of odd jobs. She has been, among others, a shepherdess, truck driver,          factory worker, cleaning lady and New York City tour guide. She has          lived in France (her native country) , Egypt and Mexico for one year          each, and China for two years. She moved to New York in 1985, where she          reinvented herself as an artist.<\/p>              <p>Coron&#39;s          oeuvre includes illustration, book arts, fine art and public art. She          cuts her characteristic silhouette designs in paper and Tyvek. She also          creates works in stone, glass, metal, rubber, stained glass and digital          media. Her work has been purchased by major museum collections, such as the Metropolitan          Museum, the Walker Art Center and The Getty. Her public art can be seen          in subways, airport and sports facilities among others. <\/p>","slug":"beatrice_coron","published_at":"2010-12-18 20:10:00","updated_at":"2011-10-28 14:45:51"}}
