I loved everything about stories -- how they made me feel and think, the joy good ones brought both the listener and the teller, the double and deeper meanings ... I knew writing made me happiest, and wrote as often as I could.<\/p><p>&quot;Now, when I&#39;m not writing, I&#39;m out speaking about writing. I write for young people and old people. I write for magazines, newspapers. I write speeches and plays. I do this because it&#39;s never not joyful for me.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"jacqueline_woodson","published_at":"2019-02-21 16:45:00","updated_at":"2019-09-11 18:31:00"}}
