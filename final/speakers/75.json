In most of the countries where his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdlf.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Media Development Loan Fund<\/a>  is active, management skills are dramatically lacking, and too often, <strong>grants backfire by creating a dependency<\/strong> that cannot be sustained when the Western donors leave. <\/p><p>All the projects supported by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdlf.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">MDLF<\/a>  espouse the reverse philosophy: It doesn&#39;t give grants. Instead, it strives to help independent media with the <em>business<\/em> of providing news. <strong>Only when a media company can sustain itself with its own revenues, says Vucinic, can it be truly independent.<\/strong> Vucinic comes by his free-press focus through experience; prior to founding the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdlf.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">MDLF<\/a>, he was a top editor with Belgrade opposition radio station <a href=\"http:\/\/www.b92.net\/eng\/\" target=\"_blank\">B92<\/a>. He&#39;s also worked for the Soros Foundations Network (which later became the Open Society Institute), advising the national foundations on how to support independent media.<\/p><p>He&#39;ll be speaking at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gfmd-athensconference.com\/node\/107\" target=\"_blank\">Global Forum for Media Development<\/a>  next month in Greece. <\/p>","slug":"sasa_vucinic","published_at":"2007-03-03 11:27:00","updated_at":"2008-11-14 06:40:07"}}
