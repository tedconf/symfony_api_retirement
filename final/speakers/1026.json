As a director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, P&auml;&auml;bo and his team developed a technique of isolating and sequencing the DNA of creatures long extinct, using a variety of fragile, ancient source material from Homo sapiens and other human species.<br \/><br \/>His work shows that all humans trace their ancestry to a small population of Africans who later spread out across the world. We&rsquo;ve also learned that Neanderthals, the short stocky hunters who disappeared 30,000 years ago, mated with the more modern human species and left their imprint deep within our genome. In 2007, <em>Time<\/em> named the Swedish biologist one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World for his work.<\/p><p>He says: &quot;Neanderthals are not totally extinct. In some of us they live on, a little bit.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"svante_paabo","published_at":"2011-05-21 10:51:00","updated_at":"2011-09-01 15:16:54"}}
