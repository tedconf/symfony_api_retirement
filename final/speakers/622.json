Mandelbrot coined the term &quot;fractal&quot; to describe these objects, and set about sharing his insight with the world.<br \/><br \/>The Mandelbrot set (expressed as z&sup2; + c) was named in Mandelbrot&#39;s honor by Adrien Douady and John H. Hubbard. Its boundary can be magnified infinitely and yet remain magnificently complicated, and its elegant shape made it <strong>a poster child for the popular understanding of fractals<\/strong>. Led by Mandelbrot&#39;s enthusiastic work, fractal math has brought new insight to the study of pretty much everything, from the behavior of stocks to the distribution of stars in the universe.<\/p><p>Benoit Mandelbrot appeared at the first TED in 1984, and returned in 2010 to give an overview of the study of fractals and the paradigm-flipping insights they&#39;ve brought to many fields. He died in October 2010 at age 85.
