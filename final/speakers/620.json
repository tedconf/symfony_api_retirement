In his book The Art Instinct, he suggested that humans are hard-wired to seek beauty.","whylisten":"<p>Why do humans take pleasure in making art? In his 2009 book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theartinstinct.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Art Instinct<\/em><\/a>, philosopher Denis Dutton suggested that art is a need built into our systems, a complex and subtle evolutionary adaptation comparable to our facility for language. We humans evolved to love art because it helps us survive; for example, a well-expressed appreciation of art can -- even in modern times -- help us to find a mate. It&rsquo;s a bold argument to make, bolstered by examples from the breadth of art history that Dutton kept at his fingertips.<\/p><p>Dutton taught philosophy at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, and was the editor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aldaily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Arts &amp; Letters Daily<\/a>, a three-column compendium of culture news from all over the web. (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.denisdutton.com\" target=\"_blank\">His own homepage<\/a>  is another storehouse of tidbits from his wide-ranging explorations in philosophy and culture.) He was on the advisory board of Cybereditions, a publisher specializing in ebooks and print-on-demand editions of nonfiction works. And he was an editor of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.climatedebatedaily.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Climate Debate Daily<\/a>, a lively blog that takes a skeptical view of some climate-change arguments.<\/p><p>Dutton died from cancer in December 2010.<\/p>","slug":"denis_dutton","published_at":"2009-12-10 12:02:00","updated_at":"2013-07-02 18:29:49"}}
