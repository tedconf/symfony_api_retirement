After receiving a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in electrical engineering from Cooper Union, Nina worked on an electronic nose used to &ldquo;smell&rdquo; lung cancer as a Fulbright scholar in Rome. She studied electrical stimulation for cardiac tissue engineering at MIT and Columbia, and now continues her research on electrical stimulation for broader tissue-engineering applications. Tandon was a 2011 TED Fellow and a 2012 Senior Fellow.
