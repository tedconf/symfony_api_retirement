As Commissioner for Competition for the European Union, Vestager is in charge of regulating commercial activity across the 28 member states and enforcing the EU&#39;s rules designed to keep the markets fair -- rules that, she believes, some big companies have been abusing. In 2016, Vestager&nbsp;ordered Apple to pay &euro;13 bn (about US$15.3 bn) in back taxes. In June 2017, she fined Google &euro;2.4 bn (US$2.8 bn) for manipulating search results in favor of its own services. Other antitrust cases are open against Google. Facebook, Amazon, Russian natural gas producer Gazprom, Italian carmaker Fiat and others are also on her radar screen.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Born in Denmark, Vestager&nbsp;held various ministerial posts in her country&#39;s government before being appointed to the European Commission in 2014. Her politics are liberal in the classic meaning of the term: free speech, free assembly and free trade -- but she argues that it can only happen if markets are free of undue influence and anti-competitive behaviors.<\/div>","slug":"margrethe_vestager","published_at":"2017-09-17 03:34:00","updated_at":"2017-10-18 14:39:23"}}
