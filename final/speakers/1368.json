At the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (in collaboration with  Nanyang Technical University, Singapore), he conducts experiments to assess the ability of  microorganisms to mine selected minerals out of seawater desalination brine. This study was based on compelling and burgeoning evidence from  the field of geomicrobiology, which shows the ubiquitous role that microorganisms play in the cycling of minerals on the planet.&nbsp;<\/p><p>He says: &quot;It is my aim to continue to research in the field of biomineralization,  while exploring the mechanisms responsible for mild energetic mineral (including metal) precipitation for the production of mineral composites.&quot;<\/p><p>Read our <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ted.com\/2012\/06\/15\/micro-metal-management-fellows-friday-with-damian-palin\/\" target=\"_blank\">in-depth Q&amp;A with Damian Palin &gt;&gt;<\/a> <\/p> ","slug":"damian_palin","published_at":"2012-06-07 16:24:00","updated_at":"2012-06-21 18:39:59"}}
