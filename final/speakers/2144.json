With two younger siblings severely affected by autism, Rosie had a burning desire to help make the world a more tolerant place for people with autism ever since she was a young girl. She found the opportunity to do so when her family was invited to do a local news segment on her mother&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s books, which featured Rosie&rsquo;s illustrations. Her lack of inhibition made her a natural presenter, and she was asked to host BBC Newsround&rsquo;s special program <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-15689138\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;My Autism and Me,&rdquo;<\/a> bringing her a much wider audience and an Emmy Kid&rsquo;s Award. Rosie continues to raise awareness about autism, and is working towards her goal of becoming a professional actress and storyteller.","slug":"rosie_king","published_at":"2014-09-19 13:50:00","updated_at":"2014-11-21 15:54:34"}}
