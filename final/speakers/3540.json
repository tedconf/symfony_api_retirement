In 2006 he was awarded a grant by the National Science Foundation to document the work of scientists in the Dry Valleys and volcanoes of Antarctica.<\/p><p>Steinmetz began his career in photography after hitchhiking through Africa for 28 months. He then spent fifteen years photographing all of the world&rsquo;s extreme deserts while piloting a motorized paraglider. This experimental aircraft enables him to capture unique images of the world, inaccessible by traditional aircraft and most other modes of transportation. He has authored four books, and his current project is documenting the challenge of meeting humanity&rsquo;s rapidly expanding demand for food.<\/p>","slug":"george_steinmetz","published_at":"2017-07-15 16:05:00","updated_at":"2018-01-24 15:30:23"}}
