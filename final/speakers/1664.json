Recognized worldwide for his obscure talent to warp and manipulate his vocal chords, he provides confirmation to his audience that there is no sound he cannot mimic to perfection.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Like many artists, Thum&#39;s talents were honed from behind his bedroom door. Spending hours listening to artists such as The Fat Boys and Dougie Fresh, he began echoing their boom-bap beats and synths with his voice. Performing at open mic nights and hip-hop jams in his hometown of Brisbane, Australia, it wasn&#39;t long before his part-time hobby became a full-time reality.<\/p><p>Thum&#39;s unique abilities have seen him perform to sold-out crowds all over the world. His recent &quot;Thum Prints&quot; collaboration with Gordon Hamilton &amp; the Queensland Symphony Orchestra has put him in a league of his own. With his vocal talents being sought out by Disney, Audi, DAB+ and more, Thum has proven that his sound is truly world class and transcends expectations.<\/p>","slug":"tom_thum","published_at":"2013-07-19 15:06:00","updated_at":"2019-03-12 14:49:55"}}
