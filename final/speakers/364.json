She communicates what she finds to non-scientists -- with the help of poets, preachers and prisoners.","whylisten":"<p>Nalini Nadkarni has spent two decades climbing the trees of Costa Rica, Papua New Guinea, the Amazon and the Pacific Northwest, exploring<strong> the world of animals and plants that live in the canopy and never come down<\/strong>; and how this upper layer of the forest interacts with the world on the ground. A pioneering researcher in this area, Nadkarni created the <a href=\"http:\/\/canopy.evergreen.edu\/bcd\/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Canopy Database<\/a>  to help researchers store and understand the rich trove of data she and others are uncovering.<\/p><p>Nadkarni teaches at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, but her work outside the academy is equally fascinating -- using nontraditional vectors to teach the general public about trees and the ecosystem. For instance, <strong>she recently collaborated with the dance troupe Capacitor to explore the process of growth through the medium of the human body.<\/strong> In another project, she worked with prison inmates to grow moss for the horticulture trade, to relieve the collecting pressure on wild mosses. The project inspired in her students a new reverence for nature -- and some larger ecochanges at the prison.<\/p><p>She&#39;s the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.powells.com\/biblio\/9780520248564?&amp;PID=30290\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Between Earth and Sky: Our Intimate Connections to Trees<\/em><\/a>. <\/p>","slug":"nalini_nadkarni","published_at":"2009-03-04 01:00:00","updated_at":"2009-03-04 08:54:03"}}
