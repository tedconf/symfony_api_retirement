A year later he was back -- as contestant. A year of mental training with Europe&#39;s top memorizer turned into a book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/moonwalking\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Moonwalking with Einstein<\/em><\/a>, which is both a chronicle of his immersion in the memory culture and wonderfully accessible and informative introduction to the science of memory. Much more surprisingly, that year of training also turned into a first-place victory at the national competition in New York and the chance to represent the U.S. at the World Memory Championship. Foer&#39;s writing has appeared in <em>National Geographic, Slate, the New York Times<\/em>, and other publications. He is the co-founder of the Atlas Obscura, an online guide to the world&rsquo;s wonders and curiosities, and is also the co-founder of the design competition Sukkah City.<\/p>","slug":"joshua_foer","published_at":"2012-01-05 16:08:00","updated_at":"2015-09-24 19:31:50"}}
