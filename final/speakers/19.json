","whylisten":"<p>In the world envisioned by science author Janine Benyus, a locust&#39;s ability to avoid collision within a roiling cloud of its brethren informs the design of a crash-resistant car; <strong>a self-cleaning leaf inspires a new kind of paint, one that dries in a pattern that enables simple rainwater to wash away dirt<\/strong>; and organisms capable of living without water open the way for vaccines that maintain potency even without refrigeration -- a hurdle that can prevent life-saving drugs from reaching disease-torn communities. Most important, these cool tools from nature pull off their tricks while still managing to <strong>preserve the environment that sustains them<\/strong>, a life-or-death lesson that humankind is in need of learning. <\/p><p>As <strong>a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biomimicryinstitute.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">champion<\/a>  of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biomimicry.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">biomimicry<\/a><\/strong>, Benyus has become one of the most important voices in a new wave of designers and engineers inspired by nature. <strong>Her most recent project, <a href=\"\/admin.php\/speakers\/edit\/speakerid\/%20www.asknature.org\">AskNature<\/a><\/strong>, explores what happens if we think of nature by function and looks at what organisms can teach us about design. <\/p>","slug":"janine_benyus","published_at":"2007-02-13 11:09:00","updated_at":"2021-05-11 19:09:41"}}
