They&#39;ve developed an  integrative approach to studying neurological disorders,  including Parkinsons disease and epilepsy. The approach, they hope, will allow the integration of molecular,  cellular, systems and behavioral data in the same animal, producing a  more complete understanding of the nature of the neurophysiological  alterations associated with these disorders.
