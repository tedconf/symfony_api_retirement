At Oxford, he researches the intersection of pheromone evolution and animal behavior, particularly in mammals. He&#39;s interested in the distinction between pheromones, the chemical signals a species produces, and each individual&#39;s signature mixture of distinct molecules. The zoologist has discovered some surprising biological coincidences along the way &mdash; like the fact that Asian elephants have the same female sex pheromones as 140 species of moths. <\/p><p>Wyatt is the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/pheremones\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pheromones and Animal Behavior<\/em><\/a>. <\/p>","slug":"tristram_wyatt","published_at":"2014-05-15 14:04:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 17:41:19"}}
