Using only his mouth, tongue, throat and vocal cords, he performs heavy, layered, club-style jams that seem to come from real drum machines and lusciously scratched turntables.","whylisten":"<p>Outside of the hip-hop world, the art of &quot;human beatboxing&quot; was mostly overlooked until the droves came to YouTube. For that trend -- from obscure fad to open mic-night fixture to full-scale Internet meme -- some credit is due to James Burchfield. Known by the handle AudioPoet, the young artist was a main figure in Seattle beatboxing competitions and open-mics in the early 2000s, and then on larger stages like San Francisco&#39;s Palace of Fine Arts Theatre.<br \/><br \/>For a musician whose goal is &quot;enlightenment of the mind,&quot; Burchfield has a fairly concrete tack: studying the mathematical formulas that are the foundation of music. He brings that knowledge -- and an <strong>instinct for dance-friendly grooves that simulate seemingly impossible-to-mimic machine sounds<\/strong> -- onto every stage.<\/p>","slug":"james_burchfield","published_at":"2008-10-10 01:00:00","updated_at":"2008-10-10 12:12:06"}}
