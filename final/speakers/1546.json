Writing on topics like white-collar crime, good governance and national development, Raymond shows that corruption shouldn&#39;t be a given. He wrote the column &ldquo;Property Matters&rdquo; in <em>The Business Guardian<\/em> from 2004 through 2012. Now, he writes on his own website, <a href=\"http:\/\/afraraymond.com\/\">AfraRaymond.com<\/a>.<\/p>  <p>Raymond looks at corruption through his lens as an expert in the fields of property valuation, project appraisal, development planning and management.
