Wearing a rigid wing powered by four model jet turbine engines, Rossy flew for eight minutes over the mile-deep trench, soaring over the red rocks before parachuting down to the Colorado River far below. It&#39;s the latest exploit in a life powered by one dream: to fly like a bird.<br \/><br \/>Wearing his single wing, Rossy really flies, steering with the movements of his body. In the last couple of years he has crossed the English Channel, flown over the Swiss Alps and performed aerobatic loops around a hot-air balloon; for his next quest, he is developing a new kind of parachute that will enable him to fly as low as 200 meters.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"yves_rossy","published_at":"2011-05-21 10:57:00","updated_at":"2014-06-23 17:07:06"}}
