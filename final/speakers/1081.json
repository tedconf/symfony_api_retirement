As a professor at both the <a href=\"http:\/\/biology.uoregon.edu\/people\/green\/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Oregon<\/a>  and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.santafe.edu\/about\/people\/profile\/Jessica%20Green\" target=\"_blank\">Santa Fe Institute<\/a>, she is the founding director of the innovative <a href=\"http:\/\/biobe.uoregon.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Biology and the Built Environment (BioBE) Center<\/a>  that bridges biology and architecture. <\/p><p>Green envisions a future with genomic-driven approaches to architectural design that promote sustainability, human health and well-being. She is spearheading efforts to model buildings as complex ecosystems that house trillions of diverse microorganisms interacting with each other, with humans, and with their environment. This framework uses next-generation sequencing technology to characterize the &ldquo;built environment microbiome&rdquo; and will offer site-specific design solutions to minimize the spread of infectious disease and maximize building energy efficiency.<\/p>","slug":"jessica_green","published_at":"2011-08-04 14:15:00","updated_at":"2013-07-22 20:48:24"}}
