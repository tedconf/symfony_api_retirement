","whylisten":"<p>Amber Case is a cyborg anthropologist, examining the way humans and technology interact and evolve together. <strong>Like all anthropologists, Case watches people, but her fieldwork involves observing how they participate in digital networks,<\/strong> analyzing the various ways we project our personalities, communicate, work, play, share ideas and even form values. Case founded Geoloqi.com, a private location-sharing application, out of a frustration with existing social protocols around text messaging and wayfinding.<\/p><p>Case, who <strong>predicts that intensification of the human-technology interface will quickly reduce the distance between individual and community,<\/strong> believes that the convergence of technologies will bring about unprecedented rapid learning and communication. <strong>Dubbed a digital philosopher,<\/strong> Case applies her findings to such fields as information architecture, usability and online productivity. She&rsquo;s currently working on a book about using anthropological techniques to understand industry ecosystems.<\/p>","slug":"amber_case","published_at":"2010-11-02 21:21:00","updated_at":"2020-10-29 01:28:48"}}
