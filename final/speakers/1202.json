In 1979, she stroked the then-longest swim in history, making the 102.5-mile journey from the island of Bimini (Bahamas) to Florida. She also broke numerous world records, including what had been a 50-year mark for circling Manhattan Island, setting the new time of 7 hrs 57 min. She is a member of the National Women&rsquo;s Hall of Fame and the International Swimming Hall of Fame.<\/p><p>At age 60, having not swum a stroke in decades, she began planning for her white whale of distance swims: the 110-mile ocean crossing between Cuba and Florida. She&#39;d tried it once, in her 20s, and severe jellyfish attacks had defeated her then. But now, with a strong team and a new commitment to her vision, she stepped back into the salt. She spoke about this second attempt <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/diana_nyad_extreme_swimming_with_the_world_s_most_dangerous_jellyfish.html\" target=\"_blank\">at TEDMED 2011<\/a>. And at TEDWomen 2013, in December, she talks about how it feels to have finally done it.<\/p><p>Nyad appears as part of a weekly five-minute radio piece on sports for KCRW called &quot;The Score&quot; (heard during KCRW&#39;s broadcast of NPR&#39;s <em>All Things Considered<\/em>), as well as for the Marketplace radio program. <\/p>","slug":"diana_nyad","published_at":"2012-01-24 15:47:00","updated_at":"2013-12-23 17:42:28"}}
