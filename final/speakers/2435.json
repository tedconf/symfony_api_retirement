(Neither livestreamed nor promoted, the jump record was announced the next day.) In a custom 500-pound  spacesuit, Eustace was strapped to a weather balloon, and rose to a height of  over 135,000 feet, where he dove to Earth at speeds exceeding 821 mph --  breaking both the sound barrier and previous records for high-altitude  jumps.<\/p>   <p> Leading up to this jump, Eustace and his partners in StratEx had spent years solving a key problem of stratosphere exploration: returning human beings to Earth from the edge of space using minimal life-support systems. In the process, they&rsquo;ve opened the door to cheaper and safer near-space travel.<\/p>","slug":"alan_eustace","published_at":"2015-01-22 22:24:00","updated_at":"2015-09-04 17:43:04"}}
