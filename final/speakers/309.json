He&#39;s a leading proponent of the vibrational theory of smell -- the idea that when our noses pick up a scent, we&#39;re reacting to the vibrational properties of the molecule we&#39;re smelling. (This is in opposition to the shape theory of smell, which imagines smelly molecules fitting into conveniently shaped receptors in our noses.) <\/p><p>His work on olfactory reception and the prediction of what a particular molecule will smell like has led to an interesting line of work: designing new fragrances and flavor molecules, as part of the firm Flexitral, where he is CTO. Coming up, he&#39;ll be part of a team in Biomedical Engineering at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mitrealnose.info\/MITRealNose\/Welcome.html\" target=\"_blank\">MIT<\/a>, headed by Professor Shuguang Zhang, to develop an artificial nose made with natural receptors as part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.darpa.mil\/dso\/solicitations\/baa07-21mod11.htm\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA<\/a>&#39;s just-launched RealNose program.<\/p><p>He&#39;s the author of several books on scent, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/2eTx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Perfumes: The Guide<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/2jtB\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret of Scent<\/a>,<\/em>&nbsp;and is the subject of Chandler Burr&#39;s 2003 book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/3TpX\" target=\"_blank\">The Emperor of Scent<\/a>.<\/em><\/p><br \/><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"luca_turin","published_at":"2008-11-07 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-10-07 18:52:05"}}
