They may happen often as a surprise, he suggests, but they don&#39;t come out of the blue: the most extreme risks (and gains) are what he calls &quot;dragon kings&quot; that almost always result from a visible drift toward a critical instability. In his hypothesis, this instability has measurable technical and\/or socio-economical precursors. As he says: &quot;Crises are not <em>external<\/em> shocks.&quot; <br \/><br \/>An expert on complex systems, Sornette is the chair of entrepreneurial risk at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and director of the Financial Crisis Observatory, a project to test the hypothesis that markets can be predictable, especially during bubbles.
