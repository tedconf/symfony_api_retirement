She was inspired to co-found the group by her work as an artist -- because her chosen material is the ubiquitous plastic bag. She writes: &quot;Having worked with the plastic bag as my primary material for the past        fifteen years, all of the obvious references to recycling, first-world culture,        class, high and low art give way to an almost formal process which reflects        the unique flexibility of the medium.&quot;<\/p><p>With the Plastic Pollution Coalition, she helps to raise awareness of ocean waste -- the majority of which is nondegradable plastic -- and everyday strategies to cut down the amount of plastic we use and throw away.<\/p>","slug":"dianna_cohen","published_at":"2010-10-20 10:54:00","updated_at":"2010-10-20 11:23:57"}}
