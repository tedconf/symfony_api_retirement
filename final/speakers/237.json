But, he says, Africa needs more than new tools to heal itself.","whylisten":"<p>Beyond high-visibility illnesses like HIV\/AIDS, Dr. Seyi Oyesola points out that <strong>common, survivable ailments and injuries -- burns, trauma, heart attacks -- kill thousands of Africans each year<\/strong> because basic medical care can be so hard to get. To help bring surgical care to every region of the continent, Oyesola co-developed CompactOR, or the &quot;Hospital in a Box&quot;: a portable medical system that contains anesthetic and surgical equipment. The operating suite is light enough to be dropped into inaccessible zones by helicopter, and can be powered by solar panels.<br \/><br \/>Although the Hospital-in-a-Box may save lives, Oyesola reminds us that <strong>with meager pay and inadequate facilities, there is still little incentive for medical professionals to remain in Africa<\/strong>. Proper education and technical training could pave the way for more, and more capable, new physicians to learn and stay in Africa -- and start the healing of the continent.<\/p>","slug":"seyi_oyesola","published_at":"2008-05-20 15:59:00","updated_at":"2008-06-22 02:30:24"}}
