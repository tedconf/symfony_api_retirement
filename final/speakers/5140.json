For the past two decades, I have been studying the cosmos -- from planets to galaxies to black holes. I am currently making a new map of the sky -- the fifth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.&quot;<\/p><p>Led to a career in astrophysics by &quot;a STEM camp in Michigan,&quot; Kollmeier is currently an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. Her research focuses on the emergence of structure in the universe on multiple scales and how the tiny fluctuations in density that were present when the universe was only 300,000 old became the stars, galaxies and black holes that we see now. Her goal is to complete this new SDSS sky map and to make sure these data remain available to the public for study.<\/p>","slug":"juna_kollmeier","published_at":"2019-02-21 16:46:00","updated_at":"2019-06-07 14:37:43"}}
