He believes it&#39;s a pivotal time for the science industry and it&#39;s the moment for the public to wake up and rethink its position on GM technologies and trials. Parry, who is the CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oxitec.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxitec<\/a>, a biotech company devoted to innovative insect control, believes the debate over GM crops and animals has become too political, and people are not stopping to evaluate the technologies&#39; true promises and efficacies. In his eyes, GM can be used responsibly for important goals, like the control of extremely harmful diseases like dengue fever.<\/p>","slug":"hadyn_parry","published_at":"2013-01-02 22:31:00","updated_at":"2013-01-03 16:01:45"}}
