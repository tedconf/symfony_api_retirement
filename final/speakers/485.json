You may never plug in again.","whylisten":"<p>Eric Giler heads WiTricity, a startup with a product straight out of science fiction:<strong> wireless electricity<\/strong>, beamed from a base station to your electrical devices. The technology was developed by an MIT team led by theoretical physicist Marin Solja&fnof;&ccedil;i&fnof;&aacute; (who won a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot;grant last year). Now, WiTricity is one of several startups developing tech to safely transmit power through the air -- and potentially untether our electronic age. <br \/><br \/>The technology at the core of WiTricity&#39;s approach is called magnetic coupled resonance, which can provoke <strong>an energetic response at a distance between two coils, one powered, the other not<\/strong>. If the two coils are correctly tuned to one another, energy flows from the connected one (installed, say, on the ceiling of a room) into the other (inside, say, your laptop). Giler presented a demo of it at TEDGlobal&nbsp; 2009 -- and several companies are already planning to add it to their phones, cameras, TVs and other devices. <\/p>","slug":"eric_giler","published_at":"2009-06-23 11:25:00","updated_at":"2009-08-25 08:58:38"}}
