I&#39;m a professor in political&nbsp;science at Texas Tech University, where I direct the Climate Science Center. I&#39;m also a lead author for the US National Climate Assessment; I host the PBS Digital Series<em>&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCi6RkdaEqgRVKi3AzidF4ow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Global Weirding<\/em><\/a>; and I spend a lot of time talking to people about climate science, impacts, solutions and how they connect to our values. I&#39;ve been named one of <em>TIME<\/em>&#39;s &quot;100 Most Influential People,&quot; <em>Fortune<\/em>&#39;s &quot;50 Greatest Leaders&quot; and <em>Foreign Policy<\/em>&#39;s &quot;100 Leading Global Thinkers.&quot;<\/p><p>&quot;These are all tremendous honors, for which I&#39;m enormously grateful. What means the most, though, is when just one person tells me sincerely that they had never cared about climate change before, or even thought it was real: but now, because of something they heard me say, they&#39;ve changed their mind. That&#39;s what makes it all worthwhile.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"katharine_hayhoe","published_at":"2018-10-04 22:55:00","updated_at":"2018-12-14 15:00:17"}}
