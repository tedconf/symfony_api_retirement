As he tells it: &quot;I&#39;ve served in government, from the White House to the Seattle Public Library Board. I&#39;ve been a leader in local and national citizen reform movements. I&#39;ve written books about democracy, power and race. And I felt I should not hoard this knowledge of how to make change happen; I should circulate it.<\/p><p>&quot;That&#39;s why I founded a nonprofit called Citizen University to foster a stronger culture of civic responsibility. Our team works with people from the left and right to teach civic power and cultivate civic character -- and to remind people that democracy works only if most people believe democracy works.&quot;<\/p><p>Liu is the author of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/cG8B\" target=\"_blank\">You&#39;re More Powerful than You Think<\/a>&nbsp;<\/em>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/S7oxx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Become America<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"eric_liu","published_at":"2014-08-14 15:11:00","updated_at":"2019-05-10 19:54:49"}}
