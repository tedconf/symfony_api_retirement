You might have seen viral videos of the quads zipping around the netting-draped GRASP Lab (they juggle! they fly through a hula hoop!). Vijay Kumar headed this lab from 1998-2004. He&#39;s now the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he continues his work in robotics, blending computer science and mechanical engineering to create the next generation of robotic wonders.<\/p>","slug":"vijay_kumar","published_at":"2012-02-20 21:07:00","updated_at":"2015-10-13 15:26:08"}}
