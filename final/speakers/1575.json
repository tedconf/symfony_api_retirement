Li studied in America (and even worked for Ross Perot&#39;s 1992 presidential campaign) before returning home, where he started doubting the idea that China&#39;s progress could only follow the path of the West&#39;s free-market principles.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>In a much-discussed op-ed he wrote for the<em> New York Times <\/em>in February 2012 and in other writings, he has put forth the idea that China needed a different development framework, around a different idea of modernity. The Chinese system, he says, is meritocratic, highly adaptable despite the one-party rule, long term-oriented, pragmatic and non-individualistic. As he writes: &quot;The Chinese political system ... comes close to the best formula for governing a large country: meritocracy at the top, democracy at the bottom, with room for experimentation in between. <br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>While some criticize him as a cheerleader of the Chinese government and a champion of Chinese exceptionalism, Li is comfortable in the role of provocateur. He is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chengwei.com\/main2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chengwei Capital<\/a>  in Shanghai, serves on the board of directors of China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and is a Fellow of the Aspen Institute.<\/p>","slug":"eric_x_li","published_at":"2013-03-29 13:49:00","updated_at":"2013-07-03 19:13:54"}}
