The first person to win a Pulitzer for film criticism, as film critic for the <em>Chicago Sun-Times<\/em>, he was best known for his decades-long reign as the co-host of <em>Sneak Previews,<\/em> a TV show with fellow Chicago critic Gene Siskel. For 23 years and three title changes (finally settling on <em>Siskel and Ebert and the Movies<\/em>) the two critics offered smart, short-form film criticism that guided America&#39;s moviegoing. After Gene Siskel died in 1999, Ebert kept on with critic Richard Roeper. (And he was also the co-screenwriter of the Russ Meyer cult classic&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/beyondthevalley\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls<\/a>,<\/em>&nbsp;a fact that astounded more than a few young film students.)<\/p><p>In 2006, Ebert began treatment for thyroid cancer. He told the story of his many surgeries and setbacks in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esquire.com\/features\/roger-ebert-0310\" target=\"_blank\">immensely-worth-reading <em>Esquire<\/em> story<\/a> in 2010. Enduring procedure after procedure, he eventually lost the lower part of his jaw -- and with it his ability to eat and speak. Turning to his blog and to Twitter, he found a new voice for his film work and his sparkling thoughts on ... just about everything. He tried his hand as an Amazon affiliate, became a finalist in the New Yorker caption contest, and started a controversy or two. In 2013 Ebert passed away from cancer at the age of 70.<\/p>","slug":"roger_ebert","published_at":"2010-12-19 19:15:00","updated_at":"2015-10-07 19:17:30"}}
