","whylisten":"<p>Pierre Barreau is the CEO of AIVA, an artificial intelligence that composes music. As Barreau writes: &quot;Ever since I was a child, I was always passionate about building things. This drive to make the imaginary real is what pushed me to create a company as soon as I got out of university. The seed of the idea for AIVA was planted once I saw the science fiction movie <em>Her<\/em>, where an AI composes a beautiful piece of piano that captures the essence of the moment she is currently living. This simple concept of creating an artificial intelligence capable of composing personalized music is how I believe that I can make the world a slightly more magical place and meaningfully support the storytelling of content creators through music.&quot;<\/p><p>Pierre&nbsp;was nominated for a Gold Panda Award in the &quot;Best Director&quot; category when he was 15 years old for a four-film documentary series,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt6613526\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>One Night in the Cosmos<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"pierre_barreau","published_at":"2018-02-11 15:05:00","updated_at":"2018-09-10 14:40:17"}}
