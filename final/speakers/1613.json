Steve Howard, the chief sustainability officer, is charged with making that supply chain, and the company&#39;s 298 stores and almost 3,000 products, live more lightly upon the earth.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Coming to Ikea from the nonprofit consultancy Climate Group, Howard has embraced the challenge of working with a single big company, and the improvements he&#39;s made so far include helping farmers grow more-sustainable cotton around the world, remaking classic products to use fewer parts, and investing &euro;1.5 billion through 2015 in renewable energy sources, notably wind and solar.

And if you&#39;ve been to an Ikea lately, you probably already know this, through signs and explainers posted all over the store. Telling the story of sustainability is key, Howard believes, as companies like his become agents of transformative change. As he says: &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve fully realized the extent to which sustainability is going to shape society and the business landscape over the next couple of decades.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"steve_howard","published_at":"2013-04-01 03:19:00","updated_at":"2015-01-23 17:17:07"}}
