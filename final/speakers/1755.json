As part of a project undertaken for Microsoft, Carter created early and successful examples of screen type emphasizing clarity and ease of long-term viewing, including the familiar Verdana, Galliard and Georgia. A recent work is MS Sitka, a family of digital fonts that are built to be readable at many sizes in print and onscreen.<\/p><p>Print and online publications such as <em>Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, Wired<\/em> and the <em>Washington Post<\/em> have all commissioned Carter fonts, leading Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/typography\/links\/News.aspx?NID=787\" target=\"_blank\">typography blog<\/a>  to call him &quot;the person who shapes the way we read about the world.&quot;<\/p><p>Carter is a principal of Carter &amp; Cone Type Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company specializing in designing and producing original typefaces.
