He has also explored the way the senses are mapped in regions of the brain and the way sensations teach the brain to recognize new patterns.<\/p><p>Merzenich wants <strong>to bring the powerful plasticity of the brain into practical use<\/strong> through technologies and methods that harness it to improve learning. He founded Scientific Learning Corporation, which markets and distributes educational software for children based on models of brain plasticity. He is co-founder and Chief Science Officer of Posit Science, which creates &quot;brain training&quot; software also based on his research. <\/p><p>Merzenich is professor emeritus of neuroscience at the University of California, San Francisco. <\/p>","slug":"michael_merzenich","published_at":"2009-04-28 07:27:00","updated_at":"2009-04-28 08:39:08"}}
