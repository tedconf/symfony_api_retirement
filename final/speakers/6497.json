Chen examines the intersections of medicine, political economy and social inequality.","whylisten":"Nancy N. Chen&#39;s research is animated by concerns for well-being, especially self-care and caregiving through food and dietary practices. In addition to her deep understanding of cultural formations of health, she&#39;s trained in human biology. She documents how ordinary citizens use kitchen knowledge and street wisdom as resourceful practices of preventative care that enable living through systemic and ecological challenges.
