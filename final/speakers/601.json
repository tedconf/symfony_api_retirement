With flowing lines, filigree and generosity, she plays in the space between a and b and c. Her illustration work has appeared in <em>Wired<\/em>, <em>Wallpaper<\/em>, the <em>Walrus<\/em> and many other magazines and newspapers worldwide, and once took over Saks Fifth Avenue top to bottom.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>She&#39;s also a blunt and funny writer on design and other matters, an advocate for self-reinvention, self-education (and formal education) and continuous self-appraisal. She works from her home on an island near Vancouver and sends legendary Valentine&#39;s Day cards.<\/p>","slug":"marian_bantjes","published_at":"2009-12-09 14:49:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 18:09:10"}}
