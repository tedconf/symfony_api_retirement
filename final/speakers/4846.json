I started life unsure of how to find a job and began helping a street theater company perform at the Edinburgh Festival. Only then did I realize that this could be a career. That was forty years ago. Since then, I&#39;ve gone on to shut down central London and other cities with ephemeral events that transform people&rsquo;s understanding of what a city is for and who controls it.<\/p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t believe that cities are exclusively about shopping and traffic. Over the years I&#39;ve developed a real sense of how artists can change the world, if only we make space for their vision. I guess that&#39;s my job -- to create a context in which the normal routines of daily life are disrupted for a moment to allow the public, especially those who know they&rsquo;re not interested in anything the arts might have to say, to discover a new world we&rsquo;d all like to live in.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"helen_marriage","published_at":"2018-10-04 21:53:00","updated_at":"2019-04-03 14:06:42"}}
