Once a child prodigy, he\u2019s matured into a creative musician, able to reimagine songs in ways few can. ","whylisten":"<p>Derek Paravicini weighed half a kilogram when he was born, prematurely at just 25 weeks. Growing up blind and with severe autism, Paravicini had trouble communicating, but was fascinated by sound. He began teaching himself how to play the piano and, by 4-years-old, had taught himself an incredible catalogue of songs that he played with unusual technique. Soon, Paravicini began studying with Adam Ockelford, a teacher at the Linden Lodge School for the Blind in London, who saw in him the marks of a highly inventive musician. Paravicini gave his first concert at age 7 and, two years later, played the Barbican Hall.<\/p>    <p>Now in his thirties, Paravicini has continued to grow as a performer, with the ability to reimagine complex pieces of music even after only hearing them once. He was featured in the series&nbsp;<em>Extraordinary People<\/em> in the United Kingdom and, in the United States, on Stan Lee&#39;s <em>Superhumans,&nbsp;<\/em>which verified his musical ability and confirmed his savantism. Paravicini has also worked with composer Matthew King. The two have played improvised pieces on BBC Radio and collaborated on <em>Blue<\/em>, the first concerto ever composed for someone with learning impairment.<\/p>","slug":"derek_paravicini","published_at":"2013-08-09 14:29:00","updated_at":"2013-08-09 14:32:17"}}
