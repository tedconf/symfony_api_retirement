By using 3D imaging, 3D printing, robotics, and medical modeling techniques, his work is helping to shift our perspective of giant herbivorous dinosaurs from their historic portrayal as hapless lumbering prey to that of fearsome, hulking, hyper-efficient eating machines.<\/p><p>Lacovara led the effort to create the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rowan.edu\/fossils\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rowan University Fossil Park<\/a>&nbsp;in suburban Mantua Township, New Jersey.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/01\/05\/science\/behind-a-shopping-center-in-new-jersey-signs-of-a-mass-extinction.html\" target=\"_blank\">The quarry<\/a>&nbsp;preserves a rich cache of marine fossils that Lacovara is using to shed light on the calamitous events that wiped out the dinosaurs.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"kenneth_lacovara","published_at":"2016-01-08 22:37:00","updated_at":"2016-04-28 18:39:08"}}
