Astrodynamicist Moriba Jah monitors this orbital debris with ASTRIAGraph, a software that tracks the positions and speeds of objects in Earth&rsquo;s orbit. Jah&#39;s vision is for AstriaGraph to become a crowd-sourced citizen-science platform that will make information about space traffic openly available to future generations.
