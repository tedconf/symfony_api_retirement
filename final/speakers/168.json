His life story is as inspiring as his musical vision.","whylisten":"<p>Raul Midon is into beating the odds, shattering stereotypes, and making category-defying music. &quot;I was told as a child, &#39;You&#39;re blind; you can&#39;t do this,&#39;&quot; Midon told an interviewer in 2005. &quot;I was told when I moved to New York, &#39;You can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re not going to make it.&#39;&quot; At 40, however, Midon has clearly made it. <\/p><p>After singing backup vocals for stars like Shakira, Julio Iglesias, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera, Midon released his major-label solo debut, <em>State of Mind<\/em>, with help from guest artist Jason Mraz. Midon&#39;s innovative songwriting incorporates his lyrics, guitar handiwork (jazz, classical, flamenco, R&amp;B) and &quot;vocal trumpet&quot; improvisation. Though he draws comparisons to Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway and Richie Havens, Midon is the rare original in an industry of few.<\/p><p>His latest album is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raulmidon.com\/disc.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A World Within a World<\/em><\/a>. <\/p>","slug":"raul_midon","published_at":"2008-01-18 01:57:00","updated_at":"2008-06-22 02:30:24"}}
