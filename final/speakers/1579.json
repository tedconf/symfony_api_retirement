Using airborne and satellite technologies such as laser scanning and hyperspectral imaging, combined with field work and computer modeling, Asner measures and qualifies humans&rsquo; impact on regions from the American Southwest to the Brazilian Amazon.<\/p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to see, if you will, the forest and the trees at the same time,&rdquo; Asner says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to now understand an image, map and measure huge expanses of the environment while maintaining the detail. Not just the spatial resolution, but the biological resolution&mdash;the actual organisms that live in these places.&rdquo; For Asner, who is on the faculty at the Carnegie Institution and Stanford and leads the <a href=\"http:\/\/cao.ciw.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Airborne Observatory<\/a> project,  this is science with a mission: to influence climate change treaties and save the forests he studies.<\/p>","slug":"greg_asner","published_at":"2013-03-29 15:56:00","updated_at":"2013-11-19 15:44:27"}}
