After meeting more than 100,000 women on an epic&nbsp; 2,300-mile on-foot journey across the country, Bakshi released a documentary, <em>WOMB: Women Of My Billion<\/em>, a poignant and heart-warming narrative exploring the social and political issues faced by women of today&#39;s India. On her journey, she identified a key issue in preventing women from escaping violence: inhibited mobility.<\/p><p>As a result, Bakshi co-founded MOWO Fleet, an initiative which trains and employs women as delivery drivers and on-demand taxi operators, providing them with the opportunity to earn both income and independence. Women can call a motorbike taxi or auto-rickshaw -- driven by a woman -- and ease the fear of sexual violence. Bakshi was awarded the Commonwealth Points of Light award for India by Queen Elizabeth II and named UN Women&#39;s Empower Women Champion for Change, an award dedicated to empowering women to achieve their full economic potential. She holds a master&#39;s degree in business administration from The Indian School of Business, Hyderabad.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"srishti_bakshi","published_at":"2021-10-20 15:42:00","updated_at":"2022-05-10 14:37:08"}}
