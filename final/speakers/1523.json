","whylisten":"              <p>Colin Stokes divides his time between parenting and building the brand of Citizen Schools, a non-profit that reimagines the school day for middle school students in low-income communities in eight states. As Managing Director of Brand &amp; Communications, Colin helps people within the organization find the ideas, words and stories that will connect with more and more people. He believes that understanding the human mind is a force that can be used for good and seeks to take advantage of our innate and learned tendencies to bring out the best in each other and our culture.<\/p>  <p>Before starting a family, Colin was an actor and graphic designer in New York City. He starred in the long-running off-Broadway musical <em>I Love You, You&rsquo;re Perfect, Now Change<\/em>, as well is in several musicals and Shakespeare stagings.
