I found a creative outlet young. I started working as an actor when I was six years old. When I was 19, I quit acting to go to college. And a few years later (yes, I dropped out) when I tried to get back into it, nobody would give me a part. That really hurt.<\/p><p>&quot;I realized my old creative outlet wouldn&#39;t work anymore, because it depended too much on other people. I had to be able to express myself on my own. And my personal metaphor for this was the REC button. &#39;HIT RECORD,&#39; I&#39;d say to myself. Push the button. Get started. Make something.<\/p><p>&quot;What started as a private rallying cry became a humble website, which grew into a worldwide community of hundreds of thousands, an Emmy-winning production company, and now a new collaborative media platform. Irony is, today&#39;s HITRECORD is not about expressing yourself on your own. What we&#39;ve found over the years is that the best way for many people to find their creative outlet is through collaborating with others.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"joseph_gordon_levitt","published_at":"2019-02-21 16:45:00","updated_at":"2019-08-20 14:34:47"}}
