His theory is based on a mathematical shape called E8. With 248 symmetries, E8 is large, complex and beautiful -- and Lisi believes the relationships of its symmetries correspond to known particles and forces, including gravity.<br \/><br \/>His work, explained  in his paper  &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/An_Exceptionally_Simple_Theory_of_Everything\" target=\"_blank\">An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything<\/a>,&quot; and in an ongoing <a href=\"http:\/\/fqxi.org\/community\/forum\/topic\/107\" target=\"_blank\">discussion<\/a>  on <a href=\"http:\/\/fqxi.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">FQXi<\/a>,  is still on science&#39;s speculative fringe. But some physicists believe he could be pointing the way toward a truly unified theory.<\/p>","slug":"garrett_lisi","published_at":"2008-10-14 01:00:00","updated_at":"2008-10-14 16:22:57"}}
