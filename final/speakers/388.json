","whylisten":"<p>A decade ago, if you wanted to buy a piece of classic modern furniture for your house -- say, a classic Eames chaise longue -- you had basically two options: make friends with a commercial office designer who could order you a piece from the supplier, or <strong>wait until your neighborhood psychiatrist redecorated his office<\/strong> and put all the 1960s-vintage Eames chairs out on the curb. Rob Forbes, a potter with a background in retail, saw a market for clean, modern design made available to regular people, and turned this idea into the brilliant nationwide chain and catalog Design Within Reach. <\/p><p>Along with new and classic home goods, DWR became a platform for Forbes&#39; way of seeing. The early-2000-vintage DWR newsletters were packed with <strong>colorful images from Forbes&#39; travels and news about designers he loved<\/strong>. And this is not to forget each holiday&#39;s annual champagne chair contest -- in which DWR fans were challenged to create a miniature modern masterpiece from the foil, wire and cork of a bottle of bubbly. <\/p><p>In July 2007, Forbes left DWR to focus on a new project, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.publicbikes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">PUBLIC<\/a>, which designs and sells urban bikes.<\/p>","slug":"rob_forbes","published_at":"2009-01-11 20:30:00","updated_at":"2011-02-02 15:43:51"}}
