As a former employee of the WFP, she supported their mission to provide school lunches in developing countries so that children could receive both the nutrition and education they need. FEED has also created special bags and a new fund to address the crisis in Haiti, helping the children they once fed at school to rebuild their schools. <br \/><br \/>At TEDxEast in May 2010, Gustafson launched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.30project.org\/\">The 30 Project<\/a> -- an effort to address the world&rsquo;s hunger and obesity problems as a holistic global food issue. In her new venture, she hopes to stimulate a movement that will change our food and agricultural systems over the next 30 years so that healthy, balanced meals are available to all. Before her efforts to fix the world&rsquo;s food issues, Gustafson&rsquo;s primary concern was international security. She wrote and edited pieces on international terrorism for ABC and was a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations. <\/p>","slug":"ellen_gustafson","published_at":"2010-07-07 08:34:00","updated_at":"2010-07-07 08:45:40"}}
