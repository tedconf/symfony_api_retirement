He demonstrated that plants, far from being passive, send SOS signals by emitting volatile substances when under attack by pests, attracting carnivorous insects to eat their enemies. Dicke <strong>opened a new field of research<\/strong> and won the NWO-Spinoza award, the Dutch Nobel prize. Now he wants to change Western minds about insects -- especially insects as food. <\/p><p>&quot;People hate bugs, but without insects we might not even exist,&quot; he says. Dicke&#39;s PR crusade began in the 1990s, as a lecture series. Then his team made world headlines when they convinced 20,000 people to attend an insect-eating festival in Waginegen. Today, Dicke leads what he says is fast-growing research into insect agriculture, and predicts that insects will be on Dutch supermarket shelves this year. And does the former vegetarian eat bugs? &quot;At least once a week. Locusts are nice cooked with garlic and herbs, served with rice or vegetables.&quot;<\/p><p>Read the UN&#39;s 2013 report, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fao.org\/docrep\/018\/i3253e\/i3253e00.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Edible Insects: Future Prospects for Food and Feed Security &gt;&gt;<\/a> <\/p>","slug":"marcel_dicke","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2013-05-13 22:35:40"}}
