In his book \"Why Does the World Exist?\" Jim Holt dares to ask.","whylisten":"<p>In his 2012 book&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/whydoestheworldexist\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story<\/em><\/a>, Jim Holt creates a narrative out of one of the biggest questions we can ask -- and how modern scientists and philosophers are asking it. Can answers be found in many-worlds theory, in quantum mechanics, in a theology? Traveling around North America and Europe, he talks to physicists, including David Deutsch; philosophers, including Richard Swinburne; and the novelist John Updike. Why? Because as he tells <em>Vanity Fair<\/em>, &quot;To me it&rsquo;s the most sublime and awesome question in all of philosophy and all of human inquiry.&quot; <br \/><br \/>A longtime contributor to the <em>New York Times, Slate <\/em>and the <em>New Yorker,<\/em> Holt has written on string theory, time, infinity, numbers, humor, logic, truth and bullshit, among other topics. Holt studied mathematics at the University of Virginia, and was a faculty fellow in the philosophy department at Columbia. He is now at work on a book about free will, weakness of will, self-knowledge and happiness.<\/p>","slug":"jim_holt","published_at":"2014-01-24 21:02:00","updated_at":"2015-09-22 20:06:28"}}
