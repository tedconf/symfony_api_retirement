","whylisten":"        <p class=\"p1\">With a background in web and mobile marketing, Australian native Adam Garone&#39;s career took a left turn in 2003 when his brother challenged him to grow out a moustache. The two wondered if they could bring the moustache back in vogue and, in the process, raise awareness for men&#39;s health along with money for prostate cancer research. Thus began the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/movember.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Movember<\/a> movement. Garone serves as CEO.<\/p> <p class=\"p1\">The Movember challenge is simple: men begin November 1st clean shaven and, for the next 30 days, grow out their moustaches while seeking out sponsorship for their efforts. The proceeds go to the Prostate Cancer Foundation as well as Livestrong. In 2011, Movember raised $126 million in 14 countries.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"adam_garone","published_at":"2012-11-01 14:08:00","updated_at":"2012-11-01 14:11:51"}}
