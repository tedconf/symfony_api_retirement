Moving unseen through the wards, he saw the patients with new eyes, as human beings rather than collections of illnesses. The experience has informed his work as a doctor -- and as a writer. &quot;Imagining the Patient&rsquo;s Experience&quot; was the motto of the Center for Medical Humanities &amp; Ethics, which he founded at the University of Texas San Antonio, where he&nbsp;brought a deep-seated empathy. He&rsquo;s now a professor for the Theory and Practice of Medicine at Stanford, where his old-fashioned weekly rounds have inspired a new initiative, the Stanford 25, teaching 25 fundamental physical exam skills and their diagnostic benefits to interns. <br \/><br \/>He&rsquo;s also a best-selling writer, with two memoirs and a novel,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/cuttingforstone\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cutting for Stone<\/em><\/a>, a moving story of two Ethiopian brothers bound by medicine and betrayal.<\/p><p>He says: &ldquo;I still find the best way to understand a hospitalized patient is not by staring at the computer screen but by going to see the patient; it&#39;s only at the bedside that I can figure out what is important.&rdquo; <\/p><p>In 2011, Verghese was elected to the Institute of Medicine, which advises the government and private institutions on medicine and health on a national level. <\/p>","slug":"abraham_verghese","published_at":"2011-05-20 14:04:00","updated_at":"2015-09-22 19:36:50"}}
