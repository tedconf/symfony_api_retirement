But it is notoriously difficult to master, which perhaps explains why it is fairly little-known. <strong>Matthew White has been playing the &quot;euph&quot;for years and years, and his mature, confident playing belies his age.<\/strong> <br \/><br \/>White was a finalist in the brass section of the 2008 BBC Young Musicians of the Year competition, and has guested with the legendary Black Dyke Band as the first honoree musician in the band&#39;s Young Artist Scheme, a yearlong fellowship. He was Principal Euphonium with the National Youth Brass Band of Great Britain, and also played with the award-winning Leyland Band. He now continues his study of the euphonium at the Royal Northern College of Music.<\/p>","slug":"matthew_white","published_at":"2009-06-23 11:18:00","updated_at":"2009-10-30 08:21:41"}}
