She chose to continue full-time employment throughout treatment and is living proof that work can play a crucial role in a person&#39;s mental and physical recovery from a serious illness. While her&nbsp;employer backed her decision, Donnelly&nbsp;has learned that the way organizations approach this issue varies greatly. This has sparked a personal mission to encourage more open conversations about why and how an individual might continue to work while undergoing treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>A lawyer by trade, Donnelly&nbsp;is currently the Head of Group Secretariat at Westpac. She is an ally for GLOBAL, Westpac Group&#39;s Employee Action Group for LGBTIQ employees, a member of Women of Westpac, an advocate of Breast Cancer Network Australia and volunteers with Vinnie&rsquo;s Van. She is an avid traveler and, when at home in Sydney&#39;s Blue Mountains, can usually be found out on a trail.<\/p>","slug":"sarah_donnelly","published_at":"2017-11-20 20:19:00","updated_at":"2018-04-26 14:22:53"}}
