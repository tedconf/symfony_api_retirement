This is a new class of materials that change in response to stimuli: conductive ink, shape-memory plastics, etc. Her goal is to encourage the making of things; to that end, she teaches hands-on workshops on high-tech materials and simple circuitry for both young people and adults--with a side benefit of encouraging interest in science, technology and knowledge-sharing. She&#39;s working on her PhD  researching the social impact of open and collaborative practices for the development of technologies. In other words: Do we make better stuff when we work together?
