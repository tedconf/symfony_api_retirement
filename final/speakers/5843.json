Seeking to understand how cells build and repair complex bodies, he earned his PhD in genetics for illuminating the bioelectrical language that all cells -- not just neurons -- use to coordinate their activities.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 2016, Levin focused on cracking the morphogenetic code: controlling biological shape by manipulating the bioelectrical software that runs on genome-specified cellular hardware. His group works to understand computation in cells and tissues. In 2021, Levin and his collaborators published &quot;<a href=\"https:\/\/robotics.sciencemag.org\/content\/6\/52\/eabf1571\" target=\"_blank\">A cellular platform for the development of synthetic living machines<\/a>,&quot; which details the generation of xenobots -- the first-ever biological robots -- and the various practical applications of writable molecular memory.<\/p>","slug":"michael_levin","published_at":"2020-02-25 19:13:00","updated_at":"2021-03-31 18:10:54"}}
