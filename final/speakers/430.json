Oh, she&#39;s got plenty of jokes. But her work, at its core, makes serious connections -- between hard science and pop culture, between what we say and what we secretly assume ... She plumbs the hidden oppositions, the untouchable not-quite-truths of the modern mind.<\/p><p>Levine&#39;s background in improv theater, with its requirement to always say &quot;yes&quot; to the other actor&#39;s reality, has helped shape her worldview. Always suspicious of sharp either\/or distinctions, she proposes &quot;the quantum logic of and\/and&quot; -- a thoroughly postmodern, scientifically informed take on life that allows for complicated states of being. Like the one we&#39;re in right now.<\/p><p>For more on Levine&#39;s thoughts about life and death, read her blog, &quot;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.emilysuniverse.com\/the-yoy-of-dying\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Yoy of Dying<\/a>,&quot; at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.emilysuniverse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">EmilysUniverse.com<\/a>, along with updates on &quot;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.emilysuniverse.com\/emily-at-the-edge-of-chaos\/\" target=\"_blank\">Emily @ the Edge of Chaos<\/a>&quot; and pronouncements from&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.emilysuniverse.com\/oracle-em\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle Em<\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"emily_levine","published_at":"2009-04-09 01:00:00","updated_at":"2018-05-18 19:21:27"}}
