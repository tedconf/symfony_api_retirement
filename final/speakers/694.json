Thirty-plus years on, his company, the Film Crew Inc., travels the oceans making underwater films for the BBC, PBS, National Geographic and Discovery Channel. <strong>He dived beneath both poles and visited the hydrothermal vents<\/strong> in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. And as you can imagine, he collected many stories along the way.<\/p><p>An accomplished diver and underwater cinematographer, deGruy also became a go-to host and expedition member on shows like the recent <em>Mysteries of the Shark Coast<\/em> with C&eacute;line Cousteau and Richard Fitzpatrick. (He was a regular on Shark Week -- and a shark attack survivor himelf.) But his first passion was cephalopods, and in fact deGruy and his team were <strong>the first to film two rarely seen cephalopods, the nautilus and the vampire squid<\/strong>, in their home ocean.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"mike_degruy","published_at":"2010-04-15 07:06:00","updated_at":"2012-02-04 21:20:51"}}
