In his day job, he&#39;s a professor of math at Harvey Mudd College; in his other day job, he&#39;s a &quot;Mathemagician,&quot; taking the stage in his tuxedo to perform high-speed mental calculations, memorizations and other astounding math stunts. It&#39;s part of his drive to teach math and mental agility in interesting ways, following in the footsteps of such heroes as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Martin_Gardner\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Gardner<\/a>.  <\/p><p>Benjamin is the co-author, with <a href=\"\/index.php\/speakers\/view\/id\/23\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Shermer<\/a>, of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/secretsofmentalmath\" target=\"_blank\">Secrets of Mental Math<\/a><\/em> (which shares his secrets for rapid mental calculation), as well as the co-author of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maa.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">MAA<\/a>  award-winning <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/proofsthatcount\" target=\"_blank\">Proofs That Really Count: The Art of Combinatorial Proof<\/a><\/em>. For a glimpse of his broad approach to math, see the list of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.math.hmc.edu\/~benjamin\/talks.html\" target=\"_blank\">research talks<\/a>  on his website, which seesaws between high-level math (such as his &quot;Vandermonde&#39;s Determinant and Fibonacci SAWs,&quot; presented at MIT in 2004) and engaging math talks for the rest of us (&quot;An Amazing Mathematical Card Trick&quot;). <\/p>","slug":"arthur_benjamin","published_at":"2007-12-03 15:19:00","updated_at":"2015-07-09 21:30:16"}}
