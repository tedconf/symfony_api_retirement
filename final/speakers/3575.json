He uses next-generation sequencing to study HIV viral diversity and superinfection. He looks at how HIV develops drug resistance to better understand why the Philippines suddenly has the fastest growing HIV epidemic in Asia and why HIV treatment that works well in developed countries is failing on emerging HIV strains in the country. He trains doctors in infectious diseases, and supervises the care of several thousand HIV patients at the Philippine General Hospital. He has been a national force in the formulation of HIV treatment guidelines, campaigning against stigma, and raising awareness.<\/p><p>Salva&ntilde;a&#39;s advocacy work has been featured in <em>Science<\/em>, and he has been recognized with numerous national and international awards including the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World&quot; from JCI International and the Young Physician Leader Award from the Interacademy Medical Panel of the World Academy of Sciences. He was named a TED Fellow in 2017.<\/p>","slug":"edsel_salvana","published_at":"2017-08-23 09:30:00","updated_at":"2020-06-26 01:52:54"}}
