Navy Admiral James Stavridis suggests that dialogue and openness will be the game-changers.","whylisten":"<p>In the world of security, says James Stavridis, &quot;we are generally focused on risk. But I think we should spend a bit of our most precious resource &mdash; time &mdash; on thinking about and developing opportunities.&quot; The first US Navy officer to hold the positions of Commander of the&nbsp;US European Command&nbsp;(USEUCOM) and of NATO&#39;s&nbsp;Supreme Allied Commander Europe&nbsp;(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nato.int\/cps\/en\/natolive\/topics_50110.htm\" target=\"_blank\">SACEUR<\/a>), Stavridis has been advocating the opportunities perspective for a long time. He sees dialogue and collaboration &mdash; between nations, and between public and private sectors &mdash; as key to the future of security. As a Navy officer, he thinks deeply about protecting the value of our &quot;global commons.&quot; And he&#39;s a rare high-ranking military officer who tweets and blogs.<\/p>  <p>He has led the recent military effort in Lybia, among other NATO engagements. Previously Stavridis commanded US Southern Command in Miami, focused on Latin America and the Caribbean.<\/p>","slug":"james_stavridis","published_at":"2012-05-02 15:25:00","updated_at":"2012-07-25 16:30:22"}}
