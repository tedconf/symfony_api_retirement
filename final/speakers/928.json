In 2014,&nbsp;only three countries remained polio-endemic.<\/p>        <p>He says: &quot;It&#39;s been estimated that our investment in smallpox eradication pays off every 26 days.&quot;<\/p>        <p>Since 2011, Aylward has also led WHO&rsquo;s work in preparedness, readiness and response to health emergencies.
