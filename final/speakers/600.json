Her work shows us how.","whylisten":"<p>Jane McGonigal asks: Why doesn&#39;t the real world work more like an online game? In the best-designed games, our human experience is optimized: We have important work to do, we&#39;re surrounded by potential collaborators, and we learn quickly and in a low-risk environment. In her work as a game designer, she creates games that use mobile and digital technologies to turn everyday spaces into playing fields, and everyday people into teammates. Her game-world insights can explain--and improve--the way we learn, work, solve problems, and lead our real lives. She served as the director of game R&amp;D at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.iftf.org\/user\/46\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for the Future<\/a>, and she is the&nbsp;founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/gameful.org\">Gameful<\/a>, which she describes as &quot;a secret headquarters for worldchanging game developers.&quot;<\/p>        <p>Several years ago she suffered a serious concussion, and she created a multiplayer game to get through it, opening it up to anyone to play. In &ldquo;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.superbetter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Superbetter<\/a>,&rdquo; players set a goal (health or wellness) and invite others to play with them--and to keep them on track. While most games, and most videogames, have traditionally been about winning, we are now seeing increasing collaboration and games played together to solve problems.<\/p>","slug":"jane_mcgonigal","published_at":"2009-12-09 14:38:00","updated_at":"2017-03-01 01:20:04"}}
