Silent heart attacks strike at-risk patients who are affected by nerve damage. Unlike most teenagers, inspired by the intricacies of the problem, Manoj translated his emotions into social motivation and, eventually, into action. At the end of three years of research and experiments funded by the Government of India at various labs across India, including SRISTI-BIRAC, he developed a novel technique that can non-invasively detect and alert at-risk patients of a potential asymptomatic heart-attack. His method involves transcutaneously isolating, identifying, spectroscopically analyzing, and sensing elevation in the levels of a cardiac biomarker called h-FABP in realtime -- a process that significantly establishes a path to preventative cardiovascular healthcare.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Manoj was awarded at the Intel ISEF 2018 and was conferred with the nation&#39;s highest honor (National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement | Gold Medallion) by the President of India.<\/p>","slug":"akash_manoj","published_at":"2018-11-13 17:07:00","updated_at":"2019-01-17 20:50:27"}}
