He is a contributing opinion writer for the <em>New York Times<\/em>&nbsp;and has written three best-selling books.<\/p><p>His most recent book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/pQmrH\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Heart: A History<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;(a finalist for the 2019 Wellcome Book prize), tells the little-known story of the doctors who risked their careers -- and the patients who risked their lives -- to understand our most vital organ. Weaving his own experiences with the defining discoveries of the past, Jauhar braids tales of breakthrough, hubris and sorrow to create a lucid chronicle of our life&#39;s most intimate chamber. The book also confronts the limits of medical technology, arguing that future progress will be determined more by how we choose to live rather than by any device we invent. Indeed, as the book explains, our emotional lives are absolutely key to our heart health. Jauhar is the Director of the Heart Failure Program at Northwell Health&#39;s Long Island Jewish Medical Center.<\/p>","slug":"sandeep_jauhar","published_at":"2019-05-31 20:21:00","updated_at":"2019-09-10 19:25:30"}}
