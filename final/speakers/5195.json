Utilizing bone conduction to transmit and receive streams of information, the result is a totally discreet and completely internal method of communication.<\/p><p>As Kapur says: &quot;This work is about enabling people and extending human intelligence. Can we weave artificial intelligence and computing into the human condition, as an extension of our cognition -- combining human creativity and intuition with the power of AI, computation and information? Can we build technology that enables us, not distracts us; that augments us, instead of replacing us; that disappears into the background of the human experience, raising us to new levels of curiosity and creativity?&quot;<\/p>","slug":"arnav_kapur","published_at":"2019-03-01 17:49:00","updated_at":"2019-05-16 14:44:23"}}
