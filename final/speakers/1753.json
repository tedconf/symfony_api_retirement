Both have the same mission: to reconnect the public with architecture.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Kushner&rsquo;s core belief is that architecture touches everyone -- and everyone is a fan of architecture, even if they don&rsquo;t know it yet. New forms of media empower people to shape the built environment, and that means better buildings, which make better cities, which make a better world. To that end he wrote the TED Book <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/FutureofArchitecture?track=speaker\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of Architecture in 100 Buildings<\/a>,<\/em>&nbsp;published in March 2015, to challenge the public to help shape tomorrow&#39;s designs.","slug":"marc_kushner","published_at":"2014-01-24 08:26:00","updated_at":"2015-07-09 19:43:18"}}
