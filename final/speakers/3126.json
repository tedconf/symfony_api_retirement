His goal: to functionally eliminate the state&#39;s chronic homelessness problem within 10 years. Through Utah&#39;s Housing First program, Pendleton prioritized providing the homeless with short-term assistance to find permanent housing quickly, and without conditions. With access to permanent, stable housing, individuals were better equipped to sustainably improve their wellbeing. The Housing First approach succeeded in reducing the number of homeless from 1,932 to 168 by 2016. Pendleton retired from state employment in June 2015&nbsp;and has since been consulting with other states about different approaches to eliminate chronic homelessness.<\/p>","slug":"lloyd_pendleton","published_at":"2016-11-21 22:28:00","updated_at":"2017-11-14 20:50:13"}}
