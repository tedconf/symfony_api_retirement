The answer is: the Leveraged Freedom Chair. Integrating science, engineering and user-driven design, Winter has developed a wheelchair that uses arm-powered levers that yield surprisingly simple, highly effective mechanical results. Even better, cheap parts means the chair costs under $200 and can be repaired easily, even in rural communities where resources are scarce.<\/p>","slug":"amos_winter","published_at":"2012-11-19 16:28:00","updated_at":"2012-11-20 16:37:51"}}
