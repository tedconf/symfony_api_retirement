She uses innovative materials to break down distinctions between plants, animals and machines -- and question what it means to be human.","whylisten":"<p>Anicka Yi fuses artistic imagination and scientific research to create artworks that both provoke and delight. Fascinated by the research of scientists and philosophers concerned with emerging forms of life and intelligence, she speculates about our understanding of life via her own form of physically-based philosophy.<\/p><p>Yi is widely known for her use of unorthodox, often living, perishable materials, including kelp &quot;skin&quot; and algae aquascapes, tempura-fried flowers and canvases fashioned from soap. Her work has been shown globally, in such venues as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris and Tate Modern in London.<\/p>","slug":"anicka_yi","published_at":"2022-02-23 21:08:00","updated_at":"2022-07-19 19:55:44"}}
