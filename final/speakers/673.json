His knack for accessible explanations made him a popularizer of physics of equal distinction to laypeople.","whylisten":"<p>Richard Feynman began his career at a crossroads in history, assisting the Manhattan Project with the development of the atomic bomb. Soon he was <strong>producing breakthrough understandings of particle physics and quantum mechanics<\/strong>, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1965. His pictorial representations of the actions of subatomic particles are still widely used today (they&#39;re now called Feynman diagrams).<\/p><p>Feynman acted as an adviser on the commission investigating the space shuttle <em>Challenger<\/em> disaster. Books based on his lectures and conversations became best-sellers, and cemented him in the public mind as an explainer of science. He was a legendary prankster, a charismatic free-thinker and an avid bongoist.<\/p>","slug":"richard_feynman","published_at":"2010-03-03 15:56:00","updated_at":"2010-03-06 09:49:59"}}
