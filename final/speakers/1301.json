The fingers, nails, thumbs, and palms of both left and right dance, pluck, strum, and slap his guitar, which bursts with a full sound.","whylisten":"<p>Most guitarists the world over play their instruments in essentially the same way: the left hand holds the neck and applies pressure to each string to change notes, while the right hand plays the melody. Not so with Preston Reed.<\/p><p>In the 1980s, Reed began playing his instrument in new ways, sometimes twisting his left hand to pick out a melody while the right hand strummed accompaniment or tapping the guitar&rsquo;s body like a drum. A new playing style was born, with deep chords, complex percussion, and weightless melodies. And he&#39;s inspired new generations of guitarists to further innovate on the genre he pioneered.<\/p>","slug":"preston_reed","published_at":"2012-04-26 20:58:00","updated_at":"2012-07-06 14:14:58"}}
