After identifying a new skeleton at a dig in North Africa, Ibrahim made the landmark conclusion that the Spinosaurus may have been the largest carnivorous dinosaur to ever live. Its crocodile-like head, dense bones, short legs, and wide, paddle feet suggest it was a water dweller unlike any other. &ldquo;The entire skeleton has water-loving river monster written all over it,&rdquo; he says.  <\/p><p>Ibrahim is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/people\/fellows?classes=ted2015\" target=\"_blank\">TED Fellow<\/a>  and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/explorers\/bios\/nizar-ibrahim\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Geographic Emerging Explorer<\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"nizar_ibrahim","published_at":"2014-11-12 19:44:00","updated_at":"2015-06-04 15:50:33"}}
