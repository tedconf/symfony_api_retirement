Parikrma&#39;s four Schools of Hope teach the full, standard Indian curriculum <strong>to children who might not otherwise see the inside of a classroom<\/strong>, with impressive results. Equally important, the schools build an &quot;end-to-end&quot; environment that supports learning -- offering lunch every day, health-care and family support. Beyond these schools, Parikrma has inaugurated several afterschool programs and has plans for setting up a central teacher-training hub. <\/p><p>Bose left behind a corporate career in 1992 to found Parikrma with a small group of friends. The nonprofit <strong>holds itself to formal business goals and strict accountability<\/strong>, and has developed some clever fundraising and marketing campaigns. As Bose puts it, the goal of Parikrma is to help build a better India by tapping its greatest strength: the vitality and potential of its people.<\/p>","slug":"shukla_bose","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2010-03-30 10:29:23"}}
