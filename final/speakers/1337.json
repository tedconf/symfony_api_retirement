In his 2007\/2010 piece &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.antonygormley.com\/show\/item-view\/id\/2230\" target=\"_blank\">Event Horizon<\/a>,&quot; he placed several dozen life-size casts of his own body on urban rooftops, where they looked out over streets and squares. Does the viewer imagine herself watched by these looming figures--or imagine being one of them? More recently, his cast iron figures have been disseminated over 150 square km in the mountain pastures of the Austrian Alps, all standing at exactly 2039 meters of altitude. &quot;They are a mediation between the domestication of the valleys and the idea of the peak,&rdquo; Gormley said of the project, codenamed &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.antonygormley.com\/sculpture\/item-view\/id\/281\" target=\"_blank\">Horizon Field<\/a>.&quot; Or take his work &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.antonygormley.com\/show\/item-view\/id\/2277\" target=\"_blank\">One &amp; Other<\/a>,&quot; in which he curated members of the public to stand on an elevated plinth over Trafalgar Square in London for one hour at a time, creating a constantly changing celebration of humanity.<\/p>  <p>This spring, he collaborated with the choreographer Hofesh Shechter to create the powerful &quot;Survivor,&quot; a piece with hundreds of dancers moving their own forms through space and time.<\/p>","slug":"antony_gormley","published_at":"2012-05-03 19:39:00","updated_at":"2016-04-06 18:32:32"}}
