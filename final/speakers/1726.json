Now, working with Robots for Humanity, he's a pioneer in adaptive robotic tech to help him, and other disabled people like him, navigate the world.","whylisten":"<p>At age 40, Henry Evans was left mute and quadriplegic after a stroke-like attack caused by a hidden birth defect. Years of therapy helped him learn to move his head and use a finger -- which allows him to use a head-tracking device to communicate with a computer using experimental interfaces. <\/p><p>Now, Evans is a frequent and enthusiastic collaborator with robotics teams who are developing tools to help the severely disabled navigate their lives. He collaborates with Georgia Tech professor Charlie Kemp on using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.willowgarage.com\/blog\/2011\/07\/13\/robots-humanity\" target=\"_blank\">Willow Garage<\/a>  PR2 robot as a surrogate, as well as Chad Jenkins&#39; <a href=\"http:\/\/brown-robotics.org\/wp\/\" target=\"_blank\">RLAB<\/a>  at Brown on quadrotors for expanding range of motion. <\/p><p>As the Willow Garage blog post says: &quot;Every day, people take for granted the simple act of scratching an itch. In Henry&#39;s case, 2-3 times every hour of every day he gets an itch he can&#39;t scratch. With the aid of a PR2, Henry was able to scratch an itch for himself for the first time in 10 years.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"henry_evans","published_at":"2013-11-20 16:10:27","updated_at":"2013-11-20 16:11:02"}}
