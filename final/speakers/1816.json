That&#39;s because this percussionist prefers brushes to sticks, and has spent his career perfecting the art of brush technique. Cameron grew up in Los Angeles and started drumming at a young age on empty oatmeal boxes. After college, he moved to Las Vegas, where he was hired as the drummer for Sammy Davis Jr.&#39;s big band. &quot;It would be Sammy&#39;s tap dancing night after night that would inspire my brush playing,&quot; says Cameron.<\/p> <p>During his tenure with Sammy Davis Jr., Cameron played with Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. And, after moving to New York, he struck up a longterm friendship with Tony Bennett, and spent 15 years touring with the master. Cameron recorded 15 albums with Bennett, including his Grammy-winning <em>Tony Bennett Unplugged<\/em>.<\/p> <p>Cameron has also worked with jazz legend Kenny Burrell, who encouraged him to teach at UCLA&#39;s Herb Alpert School of Music. In addition, Cameron released his debut album in 2012,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/herestomessengers\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Here&#39;s to the Messengers: Tribute to Art Blakey<\/em><\/a>, and formed his own group, Jazz eXplosion.
