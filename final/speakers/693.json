Photos and illustrations from Getty can be found everywhere, for just about every purpose you can imagine. It shouldn&#39;t surprise you that Getty began in the Internet age, leaving print-era agencies in the dust by using Internet and CD-ROM distribution since day one.<br \/><br \/>Jonathan Klein, Getty&#39;s co-founder (along with Mark Getty) and the current CEO, helped drive its success over the past 15 years. He led it during its aggressive archive acquisition campaign through the &#39;90s and now in the 2000s, adding to its formidable collection of editorial photos, footage and music. But his business skill is only part of his story; to hear Klein <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/jonathan_klein_photos_that_changed_the_world.html\" target=\"_blank\">talk<\/a>, one is quick to catch <strong>his passionate enthusiasm for the power of images<\/strong> -- not only to document moments in our lives and in history, not just to sell products or turn over PR campaigns -- but to shift public opinion and, perhaps, make the world more just.<br \/><br \/>Klein serves on the board of the Business Coalition on HIV\/AIDS and on the board of Real Networks (media software company and creator of the popular RealPlayer).<\/p>","slug":"jonathan_klein","published_at":"2010-04-12 16:22:00","updated_at":"2010-04-15 20:58:49"}}
