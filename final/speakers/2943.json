He&#39;s best known for making politically-charged satirical art. Safwat&#39;s artwork has used a variety of media, including illustration, writing, animation, audio, film and sculpture. He often combines several media to create multimedia storytelling experiences that get his audiences talking -- and laughing -- about subjects that tend to otherwise make people feel uncomfortable. Saleem is also the founder of Bandbaja, a Pakistani music magazine that promoted the use of modern popular music as a socio-political tool.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Saleem has a penchant for doing voiceovers in his films for all kinds of silly characters like a bear, sheep, greeting card and a whale to name a few. His work is shown regularly in galleries around the U.S. and has been featured in publications such as <em>Wired<\/em>, BoingBoing and Brainpickings. Safwat is a TED Senior Fellow and he likes pizza (like, a lot).<\/p>","slug":"safwat_saleem","published_at":"2016-02-15 18:09:00","updated_at":"2016-07-07 15:04:46"}}
