","whylisten":"<p>Joseph DeRisi is a molecular biologist and biochemist, on the hunt for the genomic basis of illness. His lab at UCSF is focused on the cause of malaria, and he&#39;s also poked into SARS, avian flu and other new diseases as they crop up. <strong>His approach combines scientific rigor with a nerd&#39;s boundary-breaking enthusiasm for new techniques<\/strong> -- one of the qualities that helped him win a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant in 2004. A self-confessed computer geek, DeRisi designed and programmed a groundbreaking tool for finding (and fighting) viruses -- the ViroChip, a DNA microarray that test for the presence of all known viruses in one step.<\/p> <p>In 2008, DeRisi won the Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment.<\/p>","slug":"joe_derisi","published_at":"2009-01-29 01:00:00","updated_at":"2009-01-29 08:54:35"}}
