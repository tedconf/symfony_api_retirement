This insight came to her in 1981, as she observed a jittery anatomy class warm to a cadaver only after cutting through its skin. As it turns out, marvels abound of this sweaty, hardwearing, social -- and underappreciated -- organ. Many are collected in her book, Skin: A Natural History, a look at what makes our skin unique and, perhaps, more important than we realize.<br \/><br \/>A fascination with the multicolored, multi-talented human hide fits Jablonski, a truly eclectic scientist. She&#39;s also a paleontologist and primatologist, studying the form, behavior and diet of mammals in light of climate change and evolution. She teaches at Penn State and recently found the world&#39;s oldest chimpanzee fossil.<\/p>","slug":"nina_jablonski","published_at":"2009-07-17 01:00:00","updated_at":"2009-07-17 08:45:35"}}
