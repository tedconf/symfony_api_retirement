This question has inspired Supasorn Suwajanakorn, a recent PhD graduate from the University of Washington, to spend years developing new tools to make it a reality. He has developed a set of algorithms that can build a moving 3D face model of anyone from just photos, which was awarded the Innovation of the Year in 2016. He then introduced the first system that can replicate a person&#39;s speech and produce a realistic CG-animation by only analyzing their existing video footage -- all without ever bringing in the person to a Hollywood capture studio.<\/p><p>Suwajanakorn is working in the field of machine learning and computer vision. His goal is to bring vision algorithms out of the lab and make them work in the wild.<\/p>","slug":"supasorn_suwajanakorn","published_at":"2018-02-17 15:02:00","updated_at":"2018-07-25 15:14:22"}}
