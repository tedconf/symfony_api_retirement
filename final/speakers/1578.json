Upon becoming Prime Minister in 2009, his government inherited a deficit that was much larger than had been reported. As PM, he implemented major changes and reforms, but was overtaken by events beyond his government&#39;s control. <\/p><p>Papandreou resigned his Prime Minister post in November 2011 as part of a deal to pave the way for a coalition government to restore Grecian stability, but remains a powerful figure as an MP and as President of the Socialist International.<\/p><p>As he says: &ldquo;We do have a choice. Either we empower Europe and its citizens and become a catalyst for humanizing our global economy, or globalization will dehumanize our societies and undermine the European project. As a citizen of Europe, I vote for the first choice.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"george_papandreou","published_at":"2013-03-29 15:38:00","updated_at":"2013-06-13 16:32:46"}}
