Considering how much stock we put into trust and assessing trusting attitudes, it&#39;s something we don&#39;t really understand, argues O&#39;Neill. What we really need, she says, is not trust -- but <em>trustworthiness<\/em>. In addition to her study of how we (wrongly) approach trust and accountability in civic life, O&#39;Neill also focuses on bioethics and international justice. <\/p><p>  O&#39;Neill&#39;s most recent book, co-written with Neil Manson is&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/informedconsent\" target=\"_blank\">Rethinking Informed Consent in Bioethics<\/a>,<\/em>&nbsp;published in 2007. She was Principal of Newnham College, a college of the University of Cambridge, from 1992 to 2006, and President of the British Academy from 2005 to 2009. In early 2013 O&#39;Neill was confirmed as the new Chair of England&#39;s Equality and Human Rights Commission. She is a crossbench member of the House of Lords.<\/p>","slug":"onora_o_neill","published_at":"2013-09-25 14:06:00","updated_at":"2015-10-03 18:37:19"}}
