She is credited as the first scientist to show that flame-retardant chemicals in consumer products have contaminated marine mammals and commercially important fish stocks in the northwest Atlantic Ocean.<br \/><br \/>An outspoken and influential voice on ocean pollution, Shaw dove in the Gulf oil slick in May and observed first-hand how oil and dispersants are impacting life in the water column. The experience prompted her to call for a collaborative, Gulf-wide effort to track effects as the toxins ripple through the food web. She was instrumental in creating the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meriresearch.org\/NEWS\/CrisisintheGulfofMexico\/tabid\/249\/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Consensus Statement<\/a>  opposing further use of dispersants in the Gulf. <\/p><p>Shaw serves on the International Panel on Chemical Pollution, a select group of scientists urging policymakers to improve management of toxic chemicals. She travels throughout the US, Europe and Asia as a speaker on the ocean crisis and chemical pollution.<\/p>","slug":"susan_shaw","published_at":"2010-07-26 11:35:00","updated_at":"2016-04-26 19:10:04"}}
