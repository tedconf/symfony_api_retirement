She studies some of the oldest art in the world -- Ice Age cave art created by early humans in Europe between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.<\/p> <p class=\"p1\">Genevieve&#39;s specific focus is on the geometric signs found at many of these sites, and she&#39;s interested in how these images can help us to better understand human cognitive evolution as well as track ancient patterns of migration and explore the origins of symbolism and graphic communication. Her research has been featured both nationally and internationally in print, radio and television. In 2013, Genevieve was selected as a TED Senior Fellow.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Genevieve has&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-First-Signs-Mysteries-Symbols\/dp\/147678549X\/\" target=\"_blank\">a book about her latest research<\/a> and this fascinating period in our human history coming out from Atria Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., in May 2016.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"genevieve_von_petzinger","published_at":"2015-08-18 08:13:00","updated_at":"2015-12-08 00:19:58"}}
