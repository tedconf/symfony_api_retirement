","whylisten":"<p>A longtime contributor to the <em>New Yorker<\/em>, Bruce McCall is a humorist and illustrator whose best-known work draws on the big-shouldered hubris of the middle 1920s and the early 1950s to create <strong>a future paradise where the skies are fllled with zeppelins<\/strong> and every car has wings. He&#39;s a wry observer of contemporary life and a witty writer.<\/p><p>McCall began his career as an illustrator for car ads -- by his own account not a very good illustrator. He&#39;d left the field and became a copywriter when, on a whim, he and a friend sent some humorous drawings to <em>Playboy<\/em> (at that time, 1970, it was a legit career move). He soon connected with the founders of the <em>National Lampoon<\/em>, a pioneering humor magazine, and went on to create some of their most enduring images -- finding in the 1970s countercultural media <strong>a rich audience for his satirical take on the Atomic Age<\/strong>. He&#39;s now working the same magic at the <em>New Yorker<\/em>. <\/p><p>His latest book is called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.powells.com\/biblio\/1-9780374399252-3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marveltown<\/em><\/a>, and is exactly what it sounds like.
