It&#39;s written in the form of a Socratic dialog, a form that Goldstein is passionate about teaching and exploring. <\/p><p>Meanwhile, her novels, from <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/mindbodyproblem\">The Mind-Body Problem (Contemporary American Fiction)<\/a><\/em> to 2011&#39;s <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/existenceofgod\">36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction (Vintage Contemporaries)<\/a><\/em>, use techniques of fiction to untangle philosophical questions, such as: How should we balance heart and mind? What should we have faith in? <\/p><p>In 1996 Goldstein became a MacArthur Fellow, receiving the prize popularly known as the &ldquo;Genius Award.&rdquo; She was designated Humanist of the Year 2011 by the American Humanist Association. She&#39;s also the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/betrayingspinoza\"><em>Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity<\/em><\/a>, a combination memoir and history.<\/p>","slug":"rebecca_newberger_goldstein","published_at":"2012-01-06 17:02:00","updated_at":"2015-07-10 20:26:17"}}
