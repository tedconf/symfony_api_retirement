Pasca is deepening our understanding of what makes the human brain unique -- and searching for effective therapies for brain disorders.","whylisten":"<p>Founding director of the Stanford Brain Organogenesis program Sergiu P. Pasca has pioneered transformational new technologies to build human brain circuits in the lab -- and gain access to previously inaccessible aspects of brain function.<\/p><p>A physician by training, Pasca developed some of the first &quot;in-a-dish&quot; models of disease by deriving neurons from skin cells taken from patients with genetic brain disorders. His lab pioneered a modular platform known as &quot;assembloids&quot; to study the wiring of the human brain -- work that was hailed as the &quot;leading edge of stem-cell research&quot; by <em>Nature<\/em> and recognized with a Breakthrough in Life Sciences Award by Falling Walls in 2020. A professor at Stanford University, he was named a &quot;Visionary in Medicine and Science&quot; by <em>The New York Times<\/em> and has received numerous awards and accolades, including the Vilcek Award for Creative Biomedical Promise in 2018, the American Philosophical Society&#39;s Judson Daland Prize in 2021 and the IBRO-Kemali Neuroscience Award in 2022.<\/p>","slug":"sergiu_p_pasca","published_at":"2020-02-28 21:17:00","updated_at":"2022-07-28 14:46:51"}}
