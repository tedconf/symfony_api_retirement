Merced realized that she could use her ears to detect patterns in stellar radio data, and could uncover connections obscured by graphs and visual representation.   <\/p><p>While working at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Merced&rsquo;s sonifications inspired musician and researcher Gerhard Sonnert to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfa.harvard.edu\/sed\/projects\/star_songs\/pages\/soundtomusic.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>X-Ray Hydra<\/em><\/a>, an album of oddly jazzy music based on her audio representations.<\/p>","slug":"wanda_diaz_merced","published_at":"2016-01-10 20:41:00","updated_at":"2016-07-08 01:23:41"}}
