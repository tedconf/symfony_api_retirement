He&rsquo;s the co-author with Johnjoe McFadden of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/lifeontheedge\" target=\"_blank\">Life on the Edge: The Coming of Age of Quantum Biology<\/a><\/em>. The book explores this emerging -- and still largely speculative -- area of science suggesting that quantum mechanics may play a role in biology. If so, it may help us understand what drives genetic mutations that lead to cancer, or how robins fly from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean.","slug":"jim_al_khalili","published_at":"2015-06-11 21:14:00","updated_at":"2015-10-13 19:06:44"}}
