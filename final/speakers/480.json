Outside of his stunt work in TV and movies, Truglia developed a nice line in jaw-dropping records. In 2002, he became the UK&#39;s deepest freediver, performing a hold-your-breath dive to 76 meters. In 2004, he set the Guinness World Record for the fastest abseil over 100 meters, covering the distance in 8.9 seconds. And (ouch) he holds the unofficial UK Full Body Burn fire record of 2 mins and 5 secs.&nbsp;Truglia died in November 2016 while attempting an abseil race from a helicopter above Wolong National Nature Reserve in China.<\/p>","slug":"steve_truglia","published_at":"2009-09-04 01:00:00","updated_at":"2018-09-12 20:08:48"}}
