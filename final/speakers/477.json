He is the author of The Ignorant Maestro.","whylisten":"<p>Itay Talgam finds metaphors for organizational behavior -- and models for inspired leadership -- within the workings of the symphony orchestra. Imagining music as a model for all spheres of human creativity, from the classroom to the boardroom, Talgam created the Maestro Leadership Program.<\/p>  <p>Talgam&#39;s workshops aim to help everyday people develop a musician&#39;s sense of collaboration, and a conductor&#39;s sense of leadership: that inner sense of being intuitively, even subconsciously, connected to your fellow players, giving what they need and getting what you need. It&#39;s this art of listening and reacting in the moment that makes for a swinging jazz combo, a sublime string quartet, a brilliant orchestra -- and great teams at work.<\/p>  <p>Before he conducted people, Talgam conducted music, including numerous orchestras in Europe. He was the first Israeli conductor to perform with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the Leipzig Opera house. His book, <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/ignorantmaestro\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Ignorant Maestro<\/em><\/a>, was published in 2015.<\/p>","slug":"itay_talgam","published_at":"2009-06-23 10:59:00","updated_at":"2015-08-13 15:51:16"}}
