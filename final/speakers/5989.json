His body of original work includes plays, performance pieces, recorded music, concerts, music theatre events, essays and long-form improvisations. Energy is his medium. He creates multi-dimensional experiences where bodies, minds, emotions, voices and spirits conjoin, shimmer and heal.<\/p><p>Jones&#39;s numerous plays and performance pieces include <em>Black Light<\/em> (Public Theater, Greenwich House Theatre); <em>Duat<\/em> (Soho Rep); <em>An Integrator&#39;s Manual<\/em> (La MaMa, etc. and Fusebox Festival); and <em>Radiate<\/em> (Soho Rep and National Tour). He has recorded five albums of original songs as his alter ego, Jomama Jones. He is recognized as a key voice in the development of theatrical jazz and has made a significant contribution to Black experimental theatre and performance. He is currently developing <em>Altar no. 5<\/em>, a commission of the Public Theater developed in partnership with New York Live Arts.<\/p><p>Jones creates his own distinctive dramaturgy. His roots reach deep into Black American and queer performance traditions, and his work explores ideas of the Afromystical (awakening awareness of the numinous in the everyday through ritualized performance). Over more than two decades of professional practice, Jones has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to civic healing through vulnerable presence, truth telling and collective critical engagement.<\/p>","slug":"daniel_alexander_jones","published_at":"2020-05-28 21:25:00","updated_at":"2021-04-22 19:37:37"}}
