Yes, putting living organisms into suspended animation -- and bringing them back safely.","whylisten":"<p>As a cell biologist in cancer research, Mark Roth studies genes, chromosomes and autoimmune disease. But he&#39;s best known for his research into suspended animation. Already, Roth has managed a world first: putting a vertebrate -- a zebrafish embryo -- into an oxygen-deprived state for several hours, then restoring it to completely normal development. He&#39;s been able to reduce the core temperature of mice to 10 degrees Celsius, and then revive them, harmlessly.<\/p><p>This MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant winner may spur the next big leap for lifesaving medical systems with techniques that buy time for critically ill trauma patients -- people in desperate need of organ transplants, for example -- whether in emergency rooms or on battlefields. DARPA is a major supporter of this work. At TED2008, geologist Peter Ward was passionate enough about Mark Roth&#39;s work to devote <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/peter_ward_on_mass_extinctions.html\" target=\"_blank\">several of his own 18 minutes<\/a>  to talking about it ...<\/p>","slug":"mark_roth","published_at":"2009-03-13 01:00:00","updated_at":"2010-03-15 08:57:45"}}
