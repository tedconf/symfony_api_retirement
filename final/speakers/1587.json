She <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=BT-3I5jg1xg\" target=\"_blank\">posted the video<\/a>  on YouTube, called on women to participate in a Women2Drive campaign on June 17 of that year, and attracted 12,000 fans to a Facebook page she&rsquo;d collaborated on called Teach Me How to Drive So I Can Protect Myself. During a second turn at the wheel, she was arrested. Nine days -- and a groundswell of protest -- later she was released from jail.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Al-Sharif, an information technology consultant, remains active in the women right&#39;s movement. She has broadened her campaign to focus on guardianship annulment and family protection as well as driving rights, and has founded several groups throughout Saudi Arabia with the title &quot;My rights, my dignity.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"manal_al_sharif","published_at":"2013-03-29 18:25:00","updated_at":"2013-06-14 08:48:22"}}
