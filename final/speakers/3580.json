During her PhD, her former team and herself identified the compounds secreted from the plant roots attracting <em>Fusarium oxysporum<\/em>, a soilborne plant pathogenic fungus and characterized the underlying mechanisms of attraction. Such compounds were tracked since the 19th century. The discovery was published in the <em>Nature Journal<\/em>.<\/p><p>El Ghalid became a TED Fellow in 2017 and have been selected as one of the 100 women honorees for OkayAfrica&#39;s 2018 #OKAY100Women list for her dedicated work and for being a promising talent within the field of STEM. She is currently working at Institut Pasteur (France) in the Biology and Pathogenicity Unit to study Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogenic fungus and the main cause of fungal infections in immunocompromised humans.<\/p>","slug":"mennat_el_ghalid","published_at":"2017-08-23 09:41:00","updated_at":"2018-03-27 19:55:28"}}
