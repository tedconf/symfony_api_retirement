She melds fiery passion and sophistication with just a hint of sandpaper grit in a voice that could only belong to a star, no matter the era or genre.<\/p><p>LeGrow&#39;s debut album, <em>Playing Ches<\/em>s (S-Curve\/BMG), draws from the catalog of Chicago&#39;s iconic Chess Records, home to pioneers like Muddy Waters, Etta James, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. Rather than faithfully recreate such revered material, LeGrow&#39;s interpretations completely transport these classic tracks to a world where the past and present are inextricably intertwined. <\/p>","slug":"elise_legrow","published_at":"2018-04-06 18:03:00","updated_at":"2018-09-12 01:38:39"}}
