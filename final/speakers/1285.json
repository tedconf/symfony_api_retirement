Following a successful career as a lawyer and business entrepreneur, Solomon, frustrated by the slow pace of medical research, was inspired to use those skills to follow another passion: accelerating medical research with real-world results as a social entrepreneur. And through her own research and conversations with medical experts, she decided that stem cells (cells that have the ability to morph into any other kind of cell) had the greatest potential to impact peoples&rsquo; health.<\/p><p>In 2005, Solomon founded the <a href=\"http:\/\/nyscf.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">New York Stem Cell Foundation<\/a>, now one of the largest nonprofit research institutions and laboratories in this field in the world. The NYSCF Research Institute conducts all facets of stem cell research from growing the cells to drug discovery.<\/p><p>At TEDGlobal 2012, Solomon announced the NYSCF Global Stem Cell Array, the new technology to create thousands of stem cell avatars and genetically array them to functionalize the data from the human genome to revolutionize the way we develop cures and treatments so they are better, safer, less expensive and happen much more quickly.<\/p>","slug":"susan_solomon","published_at":"2012-04-26 01:54:00","updated_at":"2012-09-20 11:03:07"}}
