I particularly enjoy diving in different ocean habitats and studying animals that change color and pattern -- especially octopus, cuttlefish and squid, but also various coral reef fishes.<\/p><p>&quot;I stumbled on to this journey while casually diving in Panama as a college junior and, decades later, I am still striving to figure out how these magnificent animals do what they do -- and why they do it. I am keenly interested in the &#39;visual ecology&#39; of rapid adaptive coloration used for both camouflage and communication.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"roger_hanlon","published_at":"2019-02-21 18:09:00","updated_at":"2019-05-31 17:29:20"}}
