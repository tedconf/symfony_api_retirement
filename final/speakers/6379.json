She then took an even greater leap into the unknown, arriving solo with a backpack in the Seychelles for what would prove to be five years of struggle, sometimes successful, to develop access to justice and healthy constitutional processes in a tiny island state.&nbsp;<\/p><p>She is now a mother of two and a PhD candidate and teacher at the UWA Law School in Western Australia, researching the gaps in Commonwealth writing and thinking about judges and why we (should) trust them.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"jessica_kerr","published_at":"2021-06-02 14:42:00","updated_at":"2021-06-02 14:53:00"}}
