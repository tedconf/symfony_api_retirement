His team engineered the first lab-grown organ to be implanted into a human -- a bladder -- and is developing experimental fabrication technology that can &quot;print&quot; human tissue on demand.<br \/><br \/>In 2007, Atala and a team of Harvard University researchers showed that stem cells can be harvested from the amniotic fluid of pregnant women. This and other breakthroughs in the development of smart bio-materials and tissue fabrication technology promises to revolutionize the practice of medicine.<\/p>","slug":"anthony_atala","published_at":"2010-01-21 08:28:00","updated_at":"2011-03-28 20:26:19"}}
