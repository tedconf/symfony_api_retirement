Impassioned by the silence surrounding the sex-trafficking epidemic, <strong>Sunitha Krishnan co-founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prajwalaindia.com\/\">Prajwala<\/a>, or &quot;eternal flame,&quot; a group in Hyderabad that rescues women from brothels and educates their children<\/strong> to prevent second-generation prostitution. Prajwala runs 17 schools throughout Hyderabad for 5,000 children and has rescued more than 2,500 women from prostitution, 1,500 of whom Krishnan personally liberated. At its Asha Niketan center, Prajwala helps young victims prepare for a self-sufficient future. <\/p><p><strong>Krishnan has sparked India&#39;s anti-trafficking movement by coordinating government, corporations and NGOs.<\/strong> She forged NGO-corporate partnerships with companies like Amul India, Taj Group of Hotels and Heritage Hospitals to find jobs for rehabilitated women. In collaboration with UN agencies and other NGOs, she established printing and furniture shops that have rehabilitated some 300 survivors. Krishnan works closely with the government to define anti-trafficking policy, and her recommendations for rehabilitating sex victims have been passed into state legislation.<\/p>","slug":"sunitha_krishnan","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2013-07-24 18:54:39"}}
