Parvin, who was trained in architecture but chooses to make a career looking for ideas beyond its conventional framework, wants to change that.<\/p><p>He is one of a team behind <a href=\"http:\/\/wikihouse.cc\/community\" target=\"_blank\">WikiHouse<\/a>, an open-source construction set that allows anyone to freely share model files for structures, which can then be downloaded, &quot;printed&quot; via CNC cutting machine and easily assembled. Parvin calls WikiHouse a very early experiment, the seed of what he sees as design&rsquo;s great project in the 21st century: the democratization of production.<\/p>","slug":"alastair_parvin","published_at":"2013-01-07 03:12:00","updated_at":"2013-07-30 17:33:26"}}
