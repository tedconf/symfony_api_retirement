Immediately she started packing her bags. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; her mother said. &quot;I&#39;m going to Budapest,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#39;re doing something awful and I have to go.&quot; Years later, Elworthy is a three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee and a recipient of the Niwano Peace Prize. In 2002 Elworthy founded Peace Direct, which supports local action against conflict, and in 1982 founded Oxford Research Group, a think-tank devoted to developing effective dialogue between nuclear weapons policy-makers and their critics. Beginning in 2005 she helped set up The Elders initiative as an adviser to Sir Richard Branson, Peter Gabriel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.<\/p>","slug":"scilla_elworthy","published_at":"2012-08-03 18:21:00","updated_at":"2014-08-14 14:46:37"}}
