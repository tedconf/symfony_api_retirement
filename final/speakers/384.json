(His technique, called PCR, jump-started the 1990s' biorevolution.) He's known for his wide-ranging interests -- and strong opinions.","whylisten":"<p>In the early 1980s, Kary Mullis developed the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Polymerase_chain_reaction\" target=\"_blank\">polymerase chain reaction<\/a>, an elegant way to make copies of a DNA strand using the enzyme polymerase and some basic DNA &quot;building blocks.&quot; The process opened the door to more in-depth study of DNA -- like the Human Genome Project. Mullis shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing this technique.<\/p><p>As he tells it, after winning the Nobel Prize, his next career move was to learn how to surf. It&#39;s typical of Mullis, whose scientific method is to get deeply curious about a topic, work it out from first principles, and then imagine the next giant leap forward. As he puts it in his <a href=\"http:\/\/nobelprize.org\/nobel_prizes\/chemistry\/laureates\/1993\/mullis-autobio.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nobel autobiography<\/a>, revised several times since 1993, &quot;I read a lot, and think a  \t\t\t lot, and I can talk about almost anything. Being a Nobel laureate is a license to be an  \t\t\t expert in lots of things as long as you do your homework.&quot;<\/p><p>Most recently, he&#39;s been taking a hard look at immunity; a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.patents.com\/Chemically-programmable-immunity\/US7422746\/en-US\/\" target=\"_blank\">patent<\/a>  from his company Altermune describes the redirection of an existing immune response to a new pathogen.<\/p>","slug":"kary_mullis","published_at":"2009-01-05 01:00:00","updated_at":"2016-07-14 15:02:47"}}
