It was this deep affinity for light and color that informed Rama&#39;s time as mayor of Tirana, when he literally painted the town ... every color. Rama is best known for the removal of government kiosks all over the city, thus cutting down on endemic bribery, and for the establishment of a modern new reception hall for citizens with paperwork requests. Rama&#39;s administration also demolished thousands of illegal buildings, removed hundreds of thousands of tons of concrete from riverbanks, and planted thousands of trees and bushes all over the city. Rama continues to serve as a leader of the Socialist Party of Albania.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ted.com\/2013\/02\/08\/9-views-of-tirana-albania-with-its-bright-multicolored-building\/\" target=\"_blank\">Check out photos of painted Tirana &raquo;<\/a><\/p>","slug":"edi_rama","published_at":"2013-02-08 16:00:00","updated_at":"2013-02-08 16:34:48"}}
