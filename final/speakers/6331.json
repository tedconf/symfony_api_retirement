Yoli, the woman who ran that program, had a profound impact on the trajectory of his life: he became the first member of his family to go to college, and credits that in part to the strong foundation he received at the earliest age.<\/p><p>After graduating from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Bennett moved to the Bay Area and began to hear friends discuss the shortage of quality, convenient options for childcare. He wondered: Why don&#39;t more people start their own in-home programs?<\/p><p>Wonderschool was born out of this question. Today, Wonderschool is an online platform that provides customizable technology to employers and government agencies to meet the childcare needs of their communities.
