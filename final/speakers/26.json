Students and educators tap into its vast store of texts on everything from engineering to ornithology to music, adapting the content as they see fit.","whylisten":"<p>Rice University professor Richard Baraniuk has a giant vision: to create a free global online education system that puts the power of creation and collaboration in the hands of teachers worldwide. He&#39;s realizing that vision with <a href=\"http:\/\/openstaxcollege.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStax<\/a> (formerly named Connexions), a website that allows teachers to quickly &quot;create, rip, mix and burn&quot; coursework -- without fear of copyright violations. Think of it as Napster for education.<\/p><p>OpenStax&#39;s open-source system cuts out the textbook, allowing teachers to share course materials, modify existing work and disseminate it to their students -- all for free, thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Creative Commons\">Creative Commons<\/a>  licensing. Baraniuk envisions OpenStax as a repository where the most up-to-date material can be shared and reviewed (it&#39;s far more efficient than waiting for a textbook to be printed); it could become a powerful force in leveling the education playing field. Currently encompassing hundreds of online courses and used by a million people worldwide, Baraniuk&#39;s virtual educational system is revolutionizing the way people teach and learn.<\/p>","slug":"richard_baraniuk","published_at":"2007-02-13 11:14:00","updated_at":"2014-10-24 20:03:45"}}
