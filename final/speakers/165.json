With prices depressed, many farmers simply left their grain in the field in 2001. But when the rains failed in 2002, a famine of 1984 proportions threatened the country. Her dream: to build a market that protects the African farmer, who is too often living at the mercy of forces beyond his or her control. <\/p><p>The director of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ifpri.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">International Food Policy Research Institute<\/a>, Madhin studies market reforms, market institutions, and structural transformation in Africa, and <strong>works to create &quot;a world free of hunger and malnutrition.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>","slug":"eleni_gabre_madhin","published_at":"2007-10-25 01:00:00","updated_at":"2008-06-22 02:30:24"}}
