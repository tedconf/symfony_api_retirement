Although many fixers are male, journalists increasingly seek women like Harouda for their access to areas where men are forbidden, and for a new lens on stories of human suffering often overlooked in the headlines.<\/p>","slug":"ameera_ahmad","published_at":"2016-01-09 20:07:00","updated_at":"2016-04-27 11:51:24"}}
