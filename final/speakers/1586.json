His dreams of combining these interests led him to cofound, with colleague Serge Wich, the site&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/conservationdrones.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">ConservationDrones.org<\/a>, a project dedicated to gathering intelligence on forests and wildlife through the use of low-cost unmanned flying machines.<\/p><p>Ground surveys are expensive, and are not conducted at a sufficient frequency. Furthermore, some remote tropical forests have never been really surveyed for biodiversity. Koh&#39;s machines have already collected valuable information in Sumatra, Congo, Gabon, and Madagascar.<\/p><p>He is an assistant professor of applied ecology and conservation at the ETH Zurich.<\/p>","slug":"lian_pin_koh","published_at":"2013-03-29 18:22:00","updated_at":"2013-11-18 15:36:40"}}
