His Internet Archive offers 85 billion pieces of deep Web geology -- a fascinating look at the formation of the Internet over the years, and a challenge to those who would keep knowledge buried.","whylisten":"<p>Brewster Kahle&#39;s stated goal is &quot;Universal access to all knowledge,&quot; and his catalog of inventions and institutions created for this purpose read like a Web&#39;s Greatest Hits list. In 1982 he helped start Thinking Machines, a supercomputer company specializing in text searching, and would go on to <strong>invent the Internet&#39;s first publishing and distributed search system, WAIS<\/strong>, whose customers included the <em>New York Times<\/em> and the United States Senate.<br \/><br \/>But most notably, perhaps, Kahle is founder and director of<strong> the Internet Archive, a free service which steadfastly archives World Wide Web documents<\/strong>, even as they are plowed over by breakneck trends in commerce, culture and politics. (On his Wayback Machine, you can view pages as they appeared in web antiquity -- say, Yahoo! in 1996.) As a member of the Board of Directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, he works to keep such information free and reachable.<br \/><br \/>Kahle is a key supporter of the Open Content Alliance and has been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He and his wife operate a nonprofit organization, the Kahle\/Austin Foundation, which funds the Internet Archive.<\/p>","slug":"brewster_kahle","published_at":"2008-09-10 01:00:00","updated_at":"2009-04-02 15:31:22"}}
