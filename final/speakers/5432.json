He is by all accounts a normal teenager: he serves at his local church, has a part-time job, works an internship and takes part in extracurricular activities. In early February of 2019, Lindenberger&nbsp;began to find media attention after pursuing vaccines against the approval of his mother. This became a national story and led him to testify to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee about his experiences. Since then, Lindenberger&nbsp;has continued to take part in advocating for science. He believes that everyone has a role to play in ending misinformation, and he has spoken to the importance of scientific truth while maintaining respect for those that have fallen victim to misinformation.<\/p>","slug":"ethan_lindenberger","published_at":"2019-06-06 19:26:00","updated_at":"2019-08-26 17:14:31"}}
