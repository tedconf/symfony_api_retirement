With the help of her African neighbors and colleagues at Save the Elephants in Kenya, she developed a method that reduces elephant crop destruction using bees as a natural deterrent. Her unique eco-friendly method of building beehive fences around farm boundaries has reached 19 countries in Africa and Asia, and the buzzing income-generating fences are boosting crop pollination, honey production and coexistence between rural farmers and wild elephants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"lucy_king","published_at":"2019-10-01 20:45:00","updated_at":"2020-02-06 22:42:04"}}
