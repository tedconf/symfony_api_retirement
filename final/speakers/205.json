","whylisten":"<p>Neuroscientist Christopher deCharms is helping to develop <strong>a new kind of MRI that allows doctor and patient to look inside the brain in real time<\/strong> -- to see visual representations of brain processes as they happen. With his company Omneuron, deCharms has developed technology they call rtfMRI, for &quot;real-time functional MRI&quot; -- which is exactly what it sounds like. You move your arm, your brain lights up. You feel pain, your brain lights up. <\/p><p>How could we use the ability to see our brains in action? For a start, to help treat chronic pain with a kind of biofeedback; being able to visualize pain can help patients control it. And longer-term uses boggle the mind. Ours is the first generation, he believes, to be able to <strong>train and build our minds as systematically as a weightlifter builds a muscle<\/strong>. What will we do with this?<br \/> <\/p><p>deCharms is also the author of the book <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.snowlionpub.com\/search.php?isbn=TWVIMI\" target=\"_blank\">Two Views of Mind<\/a>, <\/em>studying Buddhist theories of perception from a neuroscientist&#39;s perspective.<\/p>","slug":"christopher_decharms","published_at":"2008-03-25 05:00:00","updated_at":"2015-09-28 16:02:29"}}
