","whylisten":"<p>It&rsquo;s not every day that an opera singer is deemed &ldquo;cool.&rdquo; But Danielle de Niese does look and act, at times, more like a pop singer than an opera star. Born in Melbourne of Dutch\/Scottish\/Sri Lankan parents, de Niese started classical voice lessons at 8, and moved at 10 to Los Angeles to attend a school of performing arts, while working as a television presenter on a teen show called <em>LA Kids<\/em>. But de Niese always knew she would be a singer. At the startlingly young age of 19 she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, singing Barbarina in <em>Le nozze di Figaro<\/em>. At 25, de Niese stunned audiences and garnered international acclaim with her sultry portrayal of Cleopatra in Handel&rsquo;s <em>Giulio Cesare<\/em> at the 2005 Glyndebourne Festival in the UK. <br \/><br \/>Gracing the world&rsquo;s great opera stages and an exclusive recording contract with Decca may seem an unlikely fate for a former teen TV host born Down Under, but de Niese embraces contrasts and challenges. She&rsquo;s already starred in her own BBC4 reality show, <em>Diva Diaries<\/em>, and soon fans will be seeing her on the big screen, playing her first major film role in the Maria Callas biopic <em>Master Class<\/em>.<\/p><p>She says: &quot;What I do demands the same kind of expertise as a professional athlete.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"danielle_de_niese","published_at":"2011-05-20 14:18:00","updated_at":"2011-09-30 14:40:11"}}
