But because neither her undergraduate college or the university where she got her first master&rsquo;s degree offered astronomy majors, she threw herself wholeheartedly into physics. It wasn&rsquo;t until she entered a doctoral program that she was able to dedicate her time to the studying the night sky. In 2014, she became the first African-American woman to receive a Ph.D in Astrophysics from Yale.<\/p> <p>Isler studies blazars &mdash; supermassive hyperactive black holes at the center of galaxies, some of which emit powerful streams of particles. Sometimes these are oriented toward Earth, offering us a unique perspective on the physics of the universe. Isler is a Chancellor&rsquo;s Faculty Fellow in Physics at Syracuse University. She participates in the Future Faculty Leader program at Harvard&#39;s Center for Astrophysics and was named a 2015 TED Fellow.<\/p> <p>Isler is also interested in breaking down barriers that prevent many students &mdash; especially women of color &mdash; from becoming scienists. She works to make STEM accessible to new communities.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"jedidah_isler","published_at":"2015-03-05 18:04:00","updated_at":"2015-04-21 15:02:13"}}
