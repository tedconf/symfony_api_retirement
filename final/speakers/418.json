Since then, he&#39;s interviewed thousands of people to catalog their relationships with play, noting a <strong>strong correlation between success and playful activity<\/strong>. His book&nbsp;Play&nbsp;describes the impact play can have on one&#39;s life.&nbsp;<\/p><p>With the support of the National Geographic Society and Jane Goodall, he has observed animal play in the wild, where he first concieved of <strong>play as an evolved behavior<\/strong> important for the well being -- and survival -- of animals, especially those of higher intelligence. Now, through his organization, the National Institute for Play, he hopes to expand the study of human play into a vital science -- and help people everywhere enjoy and participate in play throughout life.<\/p>","slug":"stuart_brown","published_at":"2009-03-11 16:40:00","updated_at":"2010-08-05 16:52:48"}}
