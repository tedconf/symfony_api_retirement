In 2012 he released his debut single &quot;Fail For You,&quot; which first introduced to the world his deft ability to craft songs with a mesmerizing piercing emotional quality. The song went on to be featured in numerous TV shows including <em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy<\/em>. At the end of 2013, Sital-Singh was featured in the BBC&#39;s Sound of 2014 list and signed to Parlophone records, who released his debut record <em>The Fire Inside<\/em>&nbsp;later that year. <br \/><br \/>After a couple of years touring the world and opening for artist such as Villagers, The Staves, Martha Wainwright and Kodaline, in 2017 Sital-Singh released his sophomore record <em>Time Is A Riddle<\/em>, which featured the stand out song &quot;Killing Me.&quot; His songs are rich and somber and have the tendency to stop you in your tracks. Of his songwriting, Sital-Singh says: &quot;I like writing about the heavy things. There&rsquo;s a lot of shallow stuff out there and that&rsquo;s fine for certain contexts. My fun is diving as deep as I can. Inside myself and, if I can, inside others and writing songs that are as honest as I can make them. Honest to the struggles we all face, the sadness but more importantly, the hope.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"luke_sital_singh","published_at":"2018-03-02 15:25:00","updated_at":"2018-09-21 12:46:18"}}
