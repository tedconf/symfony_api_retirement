","whylisten":"<p>A specialist in bioluminescence, Edith Widder helps design and invent new submersible instruments and equipment to study bioluminescence and enable unobtrusive observation of deep-sea environments. Her innovative tools for exploration have produced footage of rare and wonderful bioluminescent displays and never-before-seen denizens of the deep, including, most recently, the first video ever recorded of the giant squid, <em>Architeuthis<\/em>, in its natural habitat. <br \/><br \/>In 2005 she founded the Ocean Research &amp; Conservation Association (ORCA), which is dedicated to protecting aquatic ecosystems and the species they sustain through the development of innovative technologies and science-based conservation action.;&nbsp; In an effort to protect and revitalize the ocean she loves she has been focusing on developing tools for finding and tracking pollution -- a major threat to all of our water ecosystems and ultimately to human health. She was awarded a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant in 2006.<\/p><p>In 2012, Widder was among the team that <a href=\"http:\/\/dsc.discovery.com\/show-news\/top-10-startling-giant-squid-facts.html\" target=\"_blank\">filmed the giant squid<\/a>  (<em>Architeuthis<\/em>) for the first time in its home ocean.<\/p>","slug":"edith_widder","published_at":"2010-04-19 08:27:00","updated_at":"2013-03-05 15:56:20"}}
