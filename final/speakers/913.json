More than 450,000 people from 141 countries have taken part in the project since 2011, while JR himself has continued to press forward relentlessly.<\/p><p>More recent projects include the 2018 Oscar-nominated feature documentary <em>Visages Villages<\/em>, co-directed with legendary New Wave director Agn&egrave;s Varda, a large-scale pasting in a maximum security prison in California, a <em>TIME<\/em> cover, a video mural featuring 1,200 people presented at SFMOMA, an exhibition on the abandoned hospital on Ellis Island and a huge installation at the US-Mexico border fence. Working anonymously, JR turns those who might not consider themselves typical museum visitors into art lovers.<\/p>","slug":"jr","published_at":"2010-12-19 23:37:00","updated_at":"2022-03-02 02:31:55"}}
