But on June 1, an EF3 tornado hit her hometown of Monson, Massachusetts. Caitria, along with her older sister Morgan, quickly took action. Working as lead volunteer coordinators, the two created a flexible framework for an &quot;unofficial&quot; community relief effort. By leveraging the short term spike in national interest, along with social media and database organization, Monson recorded more volunteer hours than any surrounding town -- <em>hundreds<\/em> more hours, in fact.<\/p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">After this intense experience, Catria and Morgan have translated their system into organizing software for local coordinators, through the website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recovers.org\" title=\"recovers.org\">Recovers.org<\/a>. This &ldquo;recovery in a box&rdquo; can be rolled out in minutes, helping local relief organizers turn interest into action. Caitria serves as Chief Executive Officer.<\/p>","slug":"caitria_o_neill","published_at":"2012-08-14 13:40:00","updated_at":"2014-04-11 06:52:43"}}
