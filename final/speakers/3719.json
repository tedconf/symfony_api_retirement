McCarroll&nbsp;and his team at Harvard have linked schizophrenia to specific gene variations that recruit immune molecules into &quot;pruning&quot; synapses in the brain, a discovery that is leading toward new ways of thinking about the biological basis of schizophrenia and new approaches for discovering medicines.<\/p><p>Prior to leading his lab, McCarroll&nbsp;earned his PhD in neuroscience at the University of California, San Francisco. He is also currently serving as Director of Genetics for the Broad Institute&#39;s Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research.<\/p>","slug":"steve_mccarroll","published_at":"2017-11-10 20:25:00","updated_at":"2018-09-04 14:47:17"}}
