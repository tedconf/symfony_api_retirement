It isn&#39;t a second sight or a carnival trick; he knows about the ways we think and act because <strong>he&#39;s spent years studying our behavioral patterns<\/strong>. He&#39;s traveled from country to country to learn everything he can about what makes us tick, from our relationship to our phones (hint: it&#39;s deep, and it&#39;s real) to where we stow our keys each night. He oversees the creative direction of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.frogdesign.com\/work\/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">frog design<\/a> , an innovation firm that advises the design products for Microsoft Office, Nike, UNICEF, GE, Sephora, Gatorade and Alitalia. <\/p><p>Before moving to frog design, Jan&#39;s discoveries and insights helped to <strong>inspire the development of the next generations of phones and services<\/strong> at <a href=\"http:\/\/research.nokia.com\/people\/jan_chipchase\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nokia<\/a>.
