Gangadhar Patil quit mainstream media to pursue his interest in highlighting local stories that don&rsquo;t find space in national media. After being trained in journalism at Indian Institute of Journalism &amp; New Media in Bangalore, in 2010, he began his journalism career with <em>The New Indian Express <\/em>in&nbsp;Chennai. During a one year stint with <em>Express<\/em>, he also served as Express correspondent in Coimbatore and reported briefly for Bangalore bureau. His last assignment was with India&#39;s largest business daily, <em>The Economic Times<\/em> as Senior Correspondent in New Delhi. A graduate in commerce from Bangalore University, Gangadhar&rsquo;s worldview is deeply shaped by his life experiences of growing up small towns across India. His experiences in a harsh school environment taught him that an individual&rsquo;s performance has little to do with fundamental capability, but more to do with their environment. Reflecting on his experiences working as a journalist in Belgaum and in big media companies, he began to connect the dots. He was convinced of the need to set up an independent platform to support local reporters.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"gangadhar_patil","published_at":"2019-03-01 17:55:00","updated_at":"2019-10-08 15:55:33"}}
