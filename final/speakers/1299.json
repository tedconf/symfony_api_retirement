Call it \"quantum levitation.\"","whylisten":"<p>In October 2011, Boaz Almog demonstrated how a superconducting disk can be trapped in a surrounding magnetic field to levitate above it, a phenomenon called &ldquo;quantum levitation.&rdquo; This demonstration, seemingly taken from a sci-fi movie, is the result of many years of R&amp;D on high-quality superconductors. By using exceptional superconductors cooled in liquid nitrogen, Almog and his colleague Mishael Azoulay at the superconductivity group at Tel Aviv University (lead by Prof. Guy Deutscher) were able to demonstrate a quantum effect that, although well known to physicists worldwide, had never been seen and demonstrated in such a compelling way.<\/p><p>Experiment credits: <\/p><p>Prof. Guy Deutscher, Mishael Azoulay and Boaz Almog<br \/>High Tc Superconductivity Group <br \/>School of Physics and Astronomy<br \/>Tel Aviv University<\/p><p>Watch more <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ted.com\/2012\/06\/30\/quantum-levitation-in-action-raw-footage-from-boaz-almogs-tedglobal-talk\/\" target=\"_blank\">footage from this demo &gt;&gt;<\/a> <\/p>","slug":"boaz_almog","published_at":"2012-04-26 20:15:00","updated_at":"2012-07-03 21:01:20"}}
