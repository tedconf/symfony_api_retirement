In her research, she observes the disks, gas and dust around young stars and conducts laboratory astrochemistry experiments to simulate the extreme environments in space.<\/p><p>&Ouml;berg received her B.S. in chemistry from Caltech in 2005 and her PhD in astronomy from Leiden University in 2009. She completed her postdoctoral work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics as a NASA Hubble Fellow and joined the Harvard Astronomy faculty in 2013, where she is a professor today. Her research on the chemistry of planet formation has been recognized with a Sloan Fellowship, a Packard Fellowship and the Newton Lacy Pierce Award from the American Astronomical Society.<\/p>","slug":"karin_oeberg","published_at":"2019-10-24 15:54:00","updated_at":"2020-04-10 19:16:50"}}
