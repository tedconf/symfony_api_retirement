She leads a team of scientists from the US and Europe that has been analyzing the <a href=\"http:\/\/ciclops.org\/ir_index_main.php%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\"><span class=\"s1\">images<\/span><\/a> <em>Cassini<\/em> has sent back since it left Earth in 1997. At Saturn, they have found new phenomena everywhere they&#39;ve turned their cameras &hellip; in the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere, within its rings and on the surfaces of its many moons. And they&#39;ve produced spectacular <strong>images and animations of these marvels in the process.<\/strong><\/p><p class=\"p1\">Back in the early-1980s, while still working on her doctorate, Porco was drafted onto the <em>Voyager<\/em> imaging team to assist in crunching the mountains of data coming back from <em>Voyager&rsquo;s<\/em> fly-by of Saturn. Her work on the planet&#39;s rings and their relation to its moons cemented her connection with Saturn. After <em>Voyager<\/em> had flown by Neptune and<em> <\/em>was nearing conclusion, she worked together with Carl Sagan in planning <em>Voyager&rsquo;s&nbsp;<\/em>celebrated <em>Pale Blue Dot<\/em> picture of Earth.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Her ongoing work at the <a href=\"http:\/\/ciclops.org\/index.php%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\"><span class=\"s1\">Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPs)<\/span><\/a> has two goals: to process, interpret and archive&nbsp;<em>Cassini&rsquo;s<\/em> images for other scientists, and to make sure the images -- in all <strong>their breathtaking poetry and mystery and sheer Save-Image-As-Desktop awesomeness<\/strong> -- connect with the general public. She is an advocate for the exploration and understanding of planetary space, and her frequent talks (as well as her <a href=\"http:\/\/ciclops.org\/index.php%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\"><span class=\"s1\">&quot;Captain&#39;s Log&quot; memos<\/span><\/a> on the CICLOPS website) speak to everyone, scientist and nonscientist alike. Her advocacy extends to Hollywood, where she was the character consultant on the 1997 movie &ldquo;<em>Contact<\/em>,&rdquo; and a consultant on the 2009 Paramount Pictures re-boot of &ldquo;<em>Star Trek<\/em>.&rdquo; In 2012, she was named one the 25 most influential people in space by <em>TIME<\/em> magazine.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Finally, in a twist on the Pale Blue Dot theme, it was she who conceived the idea to invite the people of the world to smile while <em>Cassini&nbsp;<\/em>imaged the Earth on July 19, 2013 in an event called &ldquo;The Day the Earth Smiled.&rdquo;<\/p><p class=\"p1\">For more information:&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ciclops.org\/view\/3211\/Solar-System-Portrait---Earth-as-Pale-Blue-Dot\" target=\"_blank\">Solar System Portrait: Earth as &#39;Pale Blue Dot&#39;<\/a><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-24913141\" target=\"_blank\">BBC: Saturn snapped as Earth smiled<\/a><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2013\/11\/the-carl-sagan-of-our-time-reprises-the-pale-blue-dot-photo-of-earth\/281414\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Atlantic:&nbsp;The Carl Sagan of Our Time Reprises the &#39;Pale Blue Dot&#39; Photo of Earth<\/a> <\/p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ciclops.org\/view.php?id=7699\" target=\"_blank\">The Day the Earth Smiled: Image<\/a><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.loc.gov\/loc\/2013\/11\/portraits-of-the-solar-system-talking-with-carolyn-porco-about-carl-sagan\/\" target=\"_blank\">Library of Congress: Portraits of the Solar System: Talking with Carolyn Porco About Carl Sagan<\/a> &nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"carolyn_porco","published_at":"2007-10-02 03:21:00","updated_at":"2015-12-07 20:01:14"}}
