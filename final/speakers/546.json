Awarded a MacArthur &quot;&quot;genius&quot;&quot; grant in 2002, he has produced and collaborated on a string of research papers that make for a must-read CV -- including a fascinating, if dispiriting, study of the corruption involved in getting a driver&#39;s license in India. <\/p><p>Lately he and his team have been studying women who sell fruit and vegetables on the streets in developing countries. They&#39;re usually in debt to a moneylender in the market, who takes about half their profits each day as interest. Some of the women have figured a simple way to get out of debt and keep all their profits. But most of the women make a choice every day that keeps them in debt. How would these businesswomen behave, he wondered, if the slate was wiped clean? So he got a grant, paid off their debt, and waits to see what happens next.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"sendhil_mullainathan","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2010-02-11 13:56:27"}}
