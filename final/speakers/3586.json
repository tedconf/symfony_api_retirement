Her work focuses on the understanding of when solar flares occur, how solar storms travel in space and how they impact planetary environments in the solar system and other star systems. In a nutshell, she works towards a better prediction of &quot;space weather,&quot; with a goal of better understanding the influence of the Sun&#39;s activity on human societies. She uses data from space missions from NASA, ESA and JAXA as well as develop 3D computer models of solar eruptions.<\/p><p>Janvier is involved as the deputy project scientist on the instrument SPICE as well as a scientific co-Investigator on the instrument EUI on board Solar Orbiter, the next European Space Agency mission to explore the winds and storms coming out from the Sun. Her passion for astrophysics and science communication has led her to partner with the movie production company TreeHouse Digital Ltd to develop a 360 degrees experience of a&nbsp;solar storm using science data and VFX. This video runs in virtual reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift or Youtube 360, with a goal of educating the public about space science.<\/p>","slug":"miho_janvier","published_at":"2017-08-23 11:37:00","updated_at":"2017-12-13 04:23:05"}}
