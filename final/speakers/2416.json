As Prime Minister during the global financial crisis (and as one of the founders of the G20), Rudd helped keep Australia out of recession with a stimulus strategy lauded by the IMF as exemplary among its member states. Rudd is also President of the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think tank specializing in Asian affairs.  <\/p><p>In March 2015, Rudd published &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/csis.org\/publication\/china-under-xi-jinping\" target=\"_blank\">China under Xi Jinping: Alternative Futures for U.S.-China Relations<\/a>,&quot; a series of three addresses on American and Chinese values, perceptions, interests, and strategic intentions, and their impact on the possibility of developing a common narrative for U.S.-China relations for the future.<\/p>","slug":"kevin_rudd","published_at":"2015-01-22 19:35:00","updated_at":"2015-04-08 19:33:22"}}
