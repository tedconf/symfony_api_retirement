After he finally convinced a commander to let him  audit ROTC classes, he proved himself a top student and earned his  uniform. Although a standard military hearing test prevents him from  enlisting, his continued fight has inspired many would-be soldiers with  disabilities -- and a vigorous online campaign on his behalf.<\/p>","slug":"keith_nolan","published_at":"2012-02-10 20:58:00","updated_at":"2012-02-12 14:52:54"}}
