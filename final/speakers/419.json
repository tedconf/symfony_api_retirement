At its core, that&#39;s what science is: it celebrates not knowing in an attempt to find better questions.<\/p><p>&quot;What if we could apply the same way of being to everything we do? What might happen if we entered conflict with a curiosity instead of an anger? The barrier to doing so is that we hate not knowing. But fortunately, evolution gave us a solution to that fear: namely, awe. Understanding how awe and wonder facilitate perception and our perceptual creations is what [my] work in neuroscience is all about.&quot;<\/p><p>Lotto recently collaborated with Cirque du Soleil to conduct an ambitious study on the emotion of awe, proving that experiencing it has far-reaching psychological and behavioral benefits.&nbsp;At TED2019, he was joined onstage by Cirque du Soleil performers in a unique performance that explored the transformational power of awe.<\/p><p>Lotto is the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/uQXq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Deviate: The Science of Seeing Differently<\/em><\/a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/AZDCi\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why We See What We Do<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"beau_lotto","published_at":"2009-03-17 13:59:00","updated_at":"2019-10-25 14:48:33"}}
