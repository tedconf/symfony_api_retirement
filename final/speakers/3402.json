Szyf&#39;s lab has proposed three decades ago that DNA methylation is a prime therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases and has postulated and provided the first set of evidence that the &quot;social environment&quot; early in life can alter DNA methylation launching the emerging field of &quot;social epigenetics.&quot;<\/p><p>Szyf received his PhD from the Hebrew University and did his postdoctoral fellowship in Genetics at Harvard Medical School, joined the department in 1989 and currently holds a James McGill Professorship and GlaxoSmithKline-CIHR Chair in Pharmacology. He is the founding co-director of the Sackler Institute for Epigenetics and Psychobiology at McGill and is a Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Experience-based Brain and Biological Development program.<\/p>","slug":"moshe_szyf","published_at":"2017-03-22 18:57:00","updated_at":"2017-03-30 15:33:08"}}
