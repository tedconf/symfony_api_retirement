Her photographs and films offer a glimpse of the cultural, religious and political realities that shape the identities of Muslim women worldwide.\r\n","whylisten":"<p>Shirin Neshat is among the best-known Persian artists in the Western world. She has lived in the United States, in self-imposed exile from her native Iran, for most of her adult life. This experience, of being caught between two cultures, dominates Neshat&rsquo;s creative work: each of her pieces offers a glimpse into the complex social, religious and political realities that shape her identity&mdash;and the identities of Muslim women worldwide. <br \/><br \/>Neshat&rsquo;s provocative photographs, videos and multimedia installations have resonated with the curators of many major international art exhibitions, including the XLVIII Venice Biennale, where she won the top prize in 1999. Her \ufb01rst feature \ufb01lm, <em>Women Without Men<\/em>, tells the stories of four women struggling to escape oppression in Tehran. It won her the Silver Lion for best director at the 2010 Venice Film Festival.<\/p>","slug":"shirin_neshat","published_at":"2010-11-04 16:42:00","updated_at":"2014-08-04 15:45:55"}}
