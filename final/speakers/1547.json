Her life was set to follow the traditional Maasai path of ending school to become a wife and mother, but Ntaiya&nbsp;had a different dream.&nbsp;<a href=\"\/talks\/kakenya_ntaiya_a_girl_who_demanded_school\" target=\"_blank\">She negotiated with her father<\/a>&nbsp;to return to school after surviving FGM. When she was accepted to college in the United States, she promised to use her education to help the village in exchange for their support. She went on to earn her PhD in education at the University of Pittsburgh, and returned to her community to fulfill her promise.<\/p><p>In 2009, the Kakenya Center for Excellence (KCE) boarding school opened its doors, serving 30 vulnerable Maasai girls in rural Kenya. Today, Kakenya&#39;s Dream reaches thousands of girls, boys and community members each year through three visionary, girl-centered programs. Ntaiya is a CNN Hero and National Geographic Emerging Explorer. She received the Feminist Majority Global Women&#39;s Rights Award and the Vital Voices Global Leadership Award.
