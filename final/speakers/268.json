Now, Wells is working on the follow-up question: How did this man, sometimes called &quot;Ychromosomal Adam,&quot; become the multicultural, globe-spanning body of life known as humanity? <\/p><p>Wells was recently named project director of the National Geographic Society&#39;s multiyear Genographic Project, which uses DNA samples to trace human migration out of Africa. In his 2002 book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/journeyofman\" target=\"_blank\">The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey<\/a>,<\/em>&nbsp;he shows how <strong>genetic data can trace human migrations over the past 50,000 years<\/strong>, as our ancestors wandered out of Africa to fill up the continents of the globe. <\/p>","slug":"spencer_wells","published_at":"2008-08-18 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-10-01 16:03:34"}}
