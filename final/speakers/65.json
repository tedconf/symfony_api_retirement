{"speaker":{"id":65,"title":"","firstname":"Jeff","middleinitial":"","lastname":"Han","description":"Human-computer interface designer","whotheyare":"After years of research on touch-driven computer displays, Jeff Han has created a simple, multi-touch, multi-user screen interface that just might herald the end of the point-and-click era. ","whylisten":"<p>Jeff Han&#39;s intuitive &quot;interface-free&quot; computer displays -- controlled by the touch of fingertips -- will change forever the way you think about computers. At TED 2006, <strong>the audience whistled, clapped and gasped audibly as Han demoed (for the first time publicly) his prototype drafting table-cum-touch display<\/strong>, developed at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cims.nyu.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">NYU&#39;s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences<\/a>. The demo included a virtual lightbox, where he moved photos by fingertip -- as if they were paper on a desk -- flicking them across the screen and zooming in and out by pinching two fingers together, as well as a Google Earth-like map that he tilted and flew over with simple moves. <\/p><p>When the demo hit the web, bloggers and YouTubers made him a bit of a megastar. (His video has been watched more than 600,000 times on YouTube alone; &quot;Amazing,&quot; &quot;Incredible&quot; and &quot;Freaking awesome&quot; are the typical responses there. Also: <strong>&quot;When can I buy one?&quot;<\/strong>) After this legendary demo, Han launched a startup called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.perceptivepixel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Perceptive Pixel<\/a>  -- and when he came back to TED2007, he and his team brought an entire interactive wall, where TEDsters lined up to play virtual guitars. His talent and reputation earned him a place on Time Magazine&#39;s 2008 list of the world&#39;s 100 Most Influential People.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"jeff_han","published_at":"2007-02-19 13:21:00","updated_at":"2010-06-18 17:25:15"}}
