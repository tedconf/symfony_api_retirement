Along the way, he realized the climate impacts of livestock and started to study the underlying causes, developed mathematical models to show where greenhouse gas emisions come from and how to directly reduce emissions, particularly methane from livestock.<\/p><p>Kebreab contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) update on livestock-related emissions and chaired the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation&#39;s task force on feed additives and methane. He has also served on two National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) committees as well as NASEM&#39;s Board of Agriculture and Natural Resources. As a professor, Kebreab&nbsp;trains undergraduate and graduate students to carry on this work. He has contributed more than 250 scientific articles to help make a difference in reducing climate impacts of livestock.<\/p>","slug":"ermias_kebreab","published_at":"2021-07-20 18:21:00","updated_at":"2022-02-24 15:31:40"}}
