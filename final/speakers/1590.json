","whylisten":"<p>In a lab in Switzerland, a little white rat is re-learning how to walk. In research dubbed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.project-rewalk.com\/#\/en\/home\" target=\"_blank\">Project Rewalk<\/a>,  Gr&eacute;goire Courtine and his collaborators are figuring out how a spinal cord with a severe lesion might repair itself, to the point that voluntary locomotion could happen again -- not just reactive movement but brain-directed walking and running. The treatment involves a re-awakening cocktail of chemicals released onto the spinal cord, combined with electrical stimulation -- plus repeated exercise that rehearses the walking movement. As part of the experiment, Courtine&#39;s team developed a robot that gently supports the rat vertically but does not push it forward; the rat has to decide to move on its own. And eventually, it does. As Courtine explains, &quot;the training forces the brain to recruit what is left of the neural system to get the job done.&quot;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Courtine holds the International Paraplegic Foundation chair in spinal cord repair at the Center for Neuroprosthetics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.<\/p>","slug":"gregoire_courtine","published_at":"2013-03-29 21:27:00","updated_at":"2013-11-06 16:11:05"}}
