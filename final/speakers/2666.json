With their &quot;Hotel Gelem&quot; project, the duo commented on racism and exclusion by inviting visitors to stay in the homes of Roma families -- a culture familiar with the idea of displacement. And in Australia at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, the two created an installation which allowed visitors to interract with refugees detained in the country.<\/p><p>&quot;We should start making our own connections, fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world,&quot; Jud says. &quot;This is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"mathias_jud","published_at":"2015-09-23 17:55:00","updated_at":"2015-10-29 15:23:45"}}
