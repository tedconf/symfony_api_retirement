She founded the SING campaign in 2007 to raise both awareness and money. &quot;This is an illness that has a lot of stigma,&quot; Lennox says on her video blog. &quot;What we need to do is normalize HIV.&quot; <\/p><p>Drawing on her talents, she combines music and film to put a human face on the crisis and emotionally connect people to the cause. South Africa has a tradition of activist songs and singing; inspired by this, in spring 2007 Lennox invited 23 female artists to record the benefit single &quot;Sing.&quot; The record incorporates the South African activist song &quot;Jikelele,&quot; which means &quot;global treatment.&quot; So far, sales of &quot;Sing&quot; have raised 100,000 pounds, while other appearances since then have multiplied that sum. SING&#39;s money goes to support efforts such as the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which works to fight mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Lennox is active in many other causes, both personal and political; in 2008 she was awarded the Services to Humanity Award by the British Red Cross.<\/p>","slug":"annie_lennox","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2010-09-22 09:19:03"}}
