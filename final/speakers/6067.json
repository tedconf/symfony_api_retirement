Before that, she was a professor at MIT where she learned that anything is possible. Her research focuses on the role the private sector can play in building a more sustainable economy, particularly how purpose-driven firms can help rebalance capitalism. For several years she taught a course on capitalism that served as the basis for her book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/2NMYBfc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire<\/em><\/a>, which was recently shortlisted for the <em>Financial Times<\/em>\/McKinsey Business Book of the Year. Despite the dire nature of the climate, she insists on remaining hopeful, quoting Howard Zinn: &quot;To be hopeful in hard times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness.&quot; Henderson believes that we can and will solve climate change.<\/p>","slug":"rebecca_henderson","published_at":"2020-08-24 22:51:00","updated_at":"2020-11-11 17:38:59"}}
