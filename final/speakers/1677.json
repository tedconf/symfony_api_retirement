Why? Because the paper was on implanting false memories in the brains of mice.","whylisten":"      <p>Steve is a graduate student at MIT&rsquo;s Brain and Cognitive Sciences department pursuing a Ph.D. in neuroscience. His work focuses on finding where single memories are located throughout the brain, genetically tricking the brain cells that house these memories to respond to brief pulses of light, and then using these same flickers of light to reactivate, erase and implant memories. The goals of his research are twofold: to figure out how the brain gives rise to the seemingly ephemeral process of memory, and to predict what happens when specific brain pieces breakdown to impair cognition. His work has been published in <em>Science<\/em>&nbsp;and covered by <em>New Scientist<\/em>, <em>Discover<\/em>, <em>Scientific American<\/em>, and Gizmodo.<\/p>   <p>Ramirez aims to be a professor who runs a lab that plucks questions from the tree of science fiction to ground them in experimental reality. He believes that a team-oriented approach to science makes research and teaching far more exciting. When he&rsquo;s not tinkering with memories in the lab, Ramirez also enjoys running and cheering on every sports team in the city of Boston.<\/p> ","slug":"steve_ramirez","published_at":"2013-08-15 13:19:00","updated_at":"2013-08-15 16:37:08"}}
