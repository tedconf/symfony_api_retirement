Their father was the famed Cuban percussionist Anga D&iacute;az, a member of the Buena Vista Social Club. The sisters&#39; music is a bewitching conflation of influences and storylines.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>While firmly rooted in their Afro-Cuban culture and history, their second album,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/xlrecordings.com\/buy\/ibeyi-ash\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ash<\/em><\/a>, features samples of a speech given by former First Lady Michelle Obama and of a song by the Bulgarian choir Les Myst&egrave;res des Voix Bulgares, the vocal stylings of the Spanish hip-hop artist Mala Rodriguez, a contribution on bass by Meshell Ndegeo-cello&nbsp;and an excerpt from The Diary of Frida Kahlo, among much more. This capacity to absorb the complexity and diversity of the world and transmute it into a vast array of emotions is the musical signature of the twins -- &quot;Ibeyi&quot; means twins in Yoruba, one of the three languages in which they sing (the others being English and French).<\/p>","slug":"ibeyi","published_at":"2017-09-17 03:38:00","updated_at":"2018-05-04 13:39:31"}}
