Her research focus has been on the development and application  of human-relevant in-vitro models for drug discovery. She  was one of the founding scientists, VP of Scientific Operations and  Director of Cell Products, in a start-up biotech company (CellzDirect),  that successfully translated and commercialized technology from academic  research to supply the pharmaceutical industry with hepatic cell  products and services for safety assessment and drug-metabolism studies.  <\/p><p>Hamilton received her Ph.D. in cell biology\/toxicology from the  University of Hertfordshire (England) in conjunction with  GlaxoSmithkline, followed by a post-doctoral research fellowship at the  University of North Carolina. Her current research interests and prior  experience include: organs on-a-chip, toxicology and drug metabolism,  liver cell biology, mechanisms regulating gene expression and  differentiation, regulation of nuclear receptors and transcriptional  activation in hepatocytes by xenobiotics, human cell isolation and  cryopreservation techniques.<\/p>","slug":"geraldine_hamilton","published_at":"2013-12-03 16:02:12","updated_at":"2013-12-03 16:03:05"}}
