Today she manages Facebook&rsquo;s sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy and communications. It&rsquo;s a massive job, but one well suited to Sandberg, who not only built and managed Google&rsquo;s successful online sales and operations program but also served as an economist for the World Bank and Chief of Staff at the US Treasury Department. Sandberg&rsquo;s experience navigating the complex and socially sensitive world of international economics has proven useful as she and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg work to strike a balance between helping Facebook users control privacy while \ufb01nding ways to monetize its most valuable asset: data.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At TEDWomen in 2010 Sandberg made the bold decision to talk about the experience of being one of very few women at the C-level of business. She noted that many women, in anticipating having a family, &quot;lean back&quot; from leading at work. After her TED Talk took off, Sandberg wrote the book&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/leanin\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lean In<\/em><\/a>, which has spent nearly a year on the <em>New York Times<\/em> Bestseller list. Sandberg plans to release a version of the book for graduates.<\/p>","slug":"sheryl_sandberg","published_at":"2010-11-04 21:48:00","updated_at":"2016-04-14 15:20:58"}}
