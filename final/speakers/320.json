Working with Dagmar Ringe, he's doing pioneering work in the way we look at proteins and what they do.","whylisten":"<p>Gregory Petsko&#39;s own biography, on his Brandeis faculty homepage, might seem intimidatingly abstruse to the non-biochemist -- he studies &quot;the structural basis for efficient enzymic catalysis of proton and hydride transfer; the role of the metal ions in bridged bimetalloenzyme active sites; direct visualization of proteins in action by time-resolved protein crystallography; the evolution of new enzyme activities from old ones; and the biology of the quiescent state in eukaryotic cells.&quot;<\/p><p>But for someone so deeply in touch with the minutest parts of our bodies, Petsko is also a wide-ranging mind, concerned about larger health policy issues. The effect of mass population shifts -- such as our current trend toward a senior-citizen society -- maps onto his world of tiny proteins to create a compeling new worldview. <\/p>","slug":"gregory_petsko","published_at":"2008-11-30 20:37:00","updated_at":"2009-04-08 15:27:07"}}
