While trying to imagine solutions, he realized the way we produce and use energy lies at the root of many of our biggest issues. Combined with his memories of summers on his family&#39;s farm on Nicaragua&#39;s Casita volcano, playing in the fumarole fields, this prompted him to pursue a PhD in geophysics at SMU, focusing on geothermal studies. He is also a National Geographic Young Explorer.<br \/><br \/>Investigating a childhood legend led him to the Shanay-timpishka, the &quot;Boiling River&quot; of the Amazon, and a sacred site to the indigenous tribes, where the water can reach over 95 &deg;C (203 &deg;F). The greatest mystery of this place: How can a &quot;boiling river&quot; exist 700 km (435 miles) from the nearest volcanic center?<\/p><p>Ruzo is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/theboilingriverintl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Boiling River: Adventure and Discovery in the Amazon<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"andres_ruzo","published_at":"2014-08-29 19:02:00","updated_at":"2017-05-11 15:08:33"}}
