Along the way, she takes the temperature of a rising caste -- the super rich -- and shows how the creation of vast fortunes at the top hollow out the middle class in western industrialised countries. This rising income inequality, she argues, has a structural character, and is becoming a cultural and social issue, with consequences for social cohesion and social mobility.<\/p><p>Freeland began her career as an &ldquo;accidental journalist&rdquo; with frontline bulletins from the Ukraine in the heat of the Soviet collapse. She is now an editor at Thomson Reuters, and is frequently featured on media outlets ranging from the <em>International Herald Tribune<\/em> to <em>The Colbert Report<\/em>.<\/p>","slug":"chrystia_freeland","published_at":"2013-03-29 12:34:00","updated_at":"2013-09-05 14:39:49"}}
