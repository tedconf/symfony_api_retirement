He's revered for his dizzying -- yet convincing -- writing on the advance of technology, the limits of biology and the future of the human species.","whylisten":"<p>Inventor, entrepreneur, visionary, Ray Kurzweil&#39;s accomplishments read as a startling series of firsts -- a litany of technological breakthroughs we&#39;ve come to take for granted. Kurzweil invented the first optical character recognition (OCR) software for transforming the written word into data, the first print-to-speech software for the blind, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, and the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition.<br \/><br \/>Yet his impact as a futurist and philosopher is no less significant.
