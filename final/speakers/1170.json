Boone Pickens is now on a mission to enhance U.S. energy policies to lessen the nation\u2019s dependence on OPEC oil.","whylisten":"<p>T. Boone Pickens views America&#39;s dependence on OPEC oil as the greatest threat to the country&#39;s national security and economic well-being. In developing The Pickens Plan for America&rsquo;s energy future, he&#39;s advocating for domestic alternatives and even greater new technologies. Pickens grew from humble beginnings in Depression-era Holdenville, Oklahoma, to be one of the nation&rsquo;s most successful oil and gas entrepreneurs, and has been uncannily accurate in predicting oil and gas prices (CNBC coined him the &ldquo;Oracle of Oil&rdquo;) -- and he&#39;s established a very successful energy-oriented investment fund. Pickens is also an innovative, committed philanthropist who has donated nearly $1 billion to charity. <\/p>","slug":"t_boone_pickens","published_at":"2012-01-06 16:16:00","updated_at":"2012-03-19 17:51:24"}}
