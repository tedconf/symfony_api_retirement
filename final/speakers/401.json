He is not quite &quot;self-educated&quot; -- he&#39;s taken many classes, but always at his own speed and in his own style, studying the things he knew he wanted to know and working closely with professors. Ironically, it&#39;s a model that cutting-edge colleges are now embracing. <\/p><p>His inventions have seeded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodynorris.com\/success.htm\" target=\"_blank\">several public companies<\/a>.
