The book had a profound effect on a generation, and she went on to script the tale into a BAFTA-winning drama for the BBC. Not limited to novels, Winterson has also written short stories, articles, screenplays, books for children and a memoir,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/6uVb\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;Her newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/XrJ6Wq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>12 Bytes: How We Got Here. Where We Might Go Next<\/em><\/a>, is pure non-fiction and considers the world of big tech and artificial intelligence -- from Mary Shelley&#39;s <em>Frankenstein<\/em> to Silicon Valley&#39;s search for immortality. She artfully weaves together strands from&nbsp; philosophy, religion, history and gender studies to create an optimistic whole that helps us understand the current moment and where we might go next.<\/p><p>Passionate about art, Winterson believes that the best hope for humanity is imagination -- whatever we invent, we must have the vision to use it well.<\/p>","slug":"jeanette_winterson","published_at":"2022-03-02 14:42:00","updated_at":"2022-07-25 16:23:59"}}
