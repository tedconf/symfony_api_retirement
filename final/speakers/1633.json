While he didn&rsquo;t respond to drugs, he responded wonderfully to deep brain stimulation. Three months after surgery, he was walking like a normal child. He&rsquo;s now a college student leading a normal life.<\/p>    <p>Lozano is a pioneer in deep brain stimulation. His team has mapped out areas of the human brain and pioneered novel surgical approaches to treat disorders like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, depression, dystonia, anorexia, Huntington&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. The chairman of neurosurgery at the University of Toronto, he holds both the R.R. Tasker Chair in Functional Neurosurgery at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Neuroscience.<\/p><p>  Lozano has over 400 publications, serves on the board of several international organizations and is a founding member of the scientific advisory board of the Michael J. Fox Foundation. He has received a number of awards including the Olivecrona Medal and the Pioneer in Medicine award, has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences and has received the Order of Spain.<\/p>","slug":"andres_lozano","published_at":"2013-04-18 14:12:00","updated_at":"2014-02-28 22:04:40"}}
