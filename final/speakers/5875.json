As the leading scientific director at UC Berkeley&#39;s Advanced BioImaging Center (ABC), Upadhyayula&#39;s vision is to provide state-of-the-art microscopy and dedicated human and hardware resources capable of handling terabyte to petabyte scale projects.<\/p><p>In addition to this, his mission is to develop robust, open source computational workflows that allow scientists to extract biologically meaningful insights. His earlier work, during his time at University of California, Riverside, includes studying the charge transfer properties of cyanine dyes and bio-inspired electrets using ultra-fast femtosecond spectroscopy; and, during his postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School \/ Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital, using lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) with high temporal and spatial resolution at the molecular level.<\/p>","slug":"gokul_upadhyayula","published_at":"2020-02-26 16:11:00","updated_at":"2020-10-12 15:26:40"}}
