In her spare time, she's a stand-up comic.","whylisten":"<p>Ella Al-Shamahi sometimes calls herself an &quot;adventure-scientist&quot; -- but to her, it&#39;s less about the adventure of working in places like Yemen, Iraq, the Nagorno-Karabakh and northern Cyprus. She believes in using expeditions to shed light on some of the most misunderstood and disadvantaged people and places on earth.<\/p><p>Al-Shamahi is a TV presenter and stand-up comic, partly because she realized that it was an incredible way to communicate science. She performs stand-up and nerdy-science stand-up in the UK and internationally. She was named a 2015 National Geographic Emerging Explorer.<\/p>","slug":"ella_al_shamahi","published_at":"2019-02-21 18:07:00","updated_at":"2021-07-19 15:40:43"}}
