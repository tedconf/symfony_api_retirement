But far from being a wild-eyed visionary, Dyson was a clear and sober thinker -- and one not afraid of controversy or heresy. ","whylisten":"<p>From inventing Dyson Spheres, a sci-fi conceit postulating habitable shells around Sol-like stars, to &quot;space chickens&quot; and trees that grow in comets, <strong>Freeman Dyson was not afraid to go out on a cosmic limb<\/strong>. It would be wrong, however, to categorize him as a publicity-hungry peddler of headline-grabbing ideas. In his 60-year career as one of planet Earth&#39;s most distinguished scientists, several things characterize Dyson more than anything else: compassion, caution and overwhelming humanism.<br \/><br \/>In addition to his work as a scientist, Dyson was a renowned and best-selling author. His book&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/manycoloredglass\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Many-Colored Glass<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;tackles nothing less than biotechnology, religion and the role of life in the universe. He didn&#39;t not shy away from controversy; his critiques of the politics of the global warming debate raised the hackles of some environmentalists. But far from wielding his conclusions like a bludgeon, Dyson wanted younger generations of scientists to take away one thing from his work -- the necessity to create heresies of their own.<\/p>","slug":"freeman_dyson","published_at":"2008-07-13 20:26:00","updated_at":"2020-02-28 22:56:38"}}
