A month before TED2009, he made the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/pressRelease\/idUS135501+07-Jan-2009+PRN20090107\" target=\"_blank\">fastest unsupported<\/a> <strong>trip to the South Pole on foot and snowshoes<\/strong>. Trekking in moon boots, while his partners Kevin Vallely and Richard Weber skiied alongside, Zahab liveblogged the trip for an audience of schoolchildren to raise awareness of the Antarctic environment.<\/p><p>He&#39;s the author of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insomniacpress.com\/title.php?id=978-1-897178-44-7\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Running for My Life<\/em><\/a>, a story of <strong>his metamorphosis from a pack-a-day smoker to an endurance athlete<\/strong> capable of such extreme feats as a 7,500 kilometer run across the Sahara. His treks are driven by an intense personal feeling for the environment; the Sahara trek, for instance, highlighted the worldwide challenge of water.<\/p><p>Ray is the founder of Impossible2Possible, and sits on the board of directors of the Ryan&#39;s Well Foundation and ONExONE Foundation.
