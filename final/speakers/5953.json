The Information Age produces conditions facilitating mass communication and democratization, as well as dystopian monitoring and centralized control. The Technology for Liberty Program aims to use our unprecedented access to information and communication to protect and enrich open society and individual rights by implementing basic reforms to ensure our new tools do not create inescapable digital cages limiting what we see, hear, think and do.<\/p> <p class=\"p1\">Towards that end, Crockford&nbsp;researches, strategizes, writes, lobbies and educates the public on issues ranging from the wars on drugs and terror to warrantless electronic surveillance. Crockford&nbsp;has written for&nbsp;<em>The Nation<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>The Guardian<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>The Boston Globe<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>WBUR<\/em>&nbsp;and many other publications, and regularly appears in local, regional and national media as an expert on issues related to technology, policing and surveillance.<\/p>","slug":"kade_crockford","published_at":"2020-05-06 20:41:00","updated_at":"2020-06-16 20:55:45"}}
