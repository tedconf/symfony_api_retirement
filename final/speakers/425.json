Throughout his long life, he shared the values and life lessons he passed to his players, emphasizing success that\u2019s about much more than winning. ","whylisten":"<p>Born in 1910, Coach John Wooden was the first person to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and coach, while <strong>ESPN ranks him as the greatest coach of all time, across all sports<\/strong>. In his 40 years at UCLA, he mentored legends such as Bill Walton and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He has created a model, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coachwooden.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pyramid of Success<\/a>, and authored several books to impart his insight on achievement to others.<br \/><br \/>Coach wanted his players to be victors in life and not just on the court, so he treated them as an extended family and emphasized that <strong>winning was more than scoring<\/strong>. Indeed, most of his inspiring theories were born from conversations with his father, as a boy on their farm in Indiana. One that sums up his ideology quite well is his often-quoted definition of success: &quot;Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"john_wooden","published_at":"2009-03-25 20:52:00","updated_at":"2010-06-05 08:56:11"}}
