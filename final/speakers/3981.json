Positive role models and a positive self-identity are hard to come by, yet the Canadian DJ collective A Tribe Called Red (ATCR) is a modern gateway into urban and contemporary indigenous culture and experience, celebrating all its layers and complexity.<\/p><p>Looking to the future, without losing sight of their past, ATCR straddles a broad range of musical influences based in modern hip-hop, traditional powwow drums and vocals, blended with edgy electronic music production styles. Currently made up of Bear Witness and 2oolman, ATCR first got together in 2008. They are part of a vital new generation of artists making a cultural and social impact in Canada alongside a renewed Aboriginal rights movement called Idle No More.<\/p><p>The crew has performed high profile festival dates at Coachella, Bonnaroo, AfroPunk, Osheaga, and New Orleans Jazz Fest to list a few. They promote&nbsp;inclusivity, empathy and acceptance amongst all races and genders in the name of social justice. They believe that indigenous people need to define their identity on their own terms.<\/p><p>Check out ATCR on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/aTribeCalledRed\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2jlWF9ltd8UtoaqW0PxY4z?si=HbFsFp2aSO-BqJRf-YuzHA\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify<\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"a_tribe_called_red","published_at":"2018-02-17 15:42:00","updated_at":"2018-10-25 21:26:05"}}
