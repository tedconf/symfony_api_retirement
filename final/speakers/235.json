Oh, and he found the Titanic.","whylisten":"<p>From an early age, Robert Ballard was intrigued by the deep. He&#39;s perhaps best-known for his work in underwater archaeology; in addition to <em>Titanic<\/em>, he has found the wrecks of the <em>Bismarck<\/em>, the USS <em>Yorktown<\/em>, <strong>the nuclear sub <em>Thresher<\/em> (on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/nova\/transcripts\/2602subsecrets.html\" target=\"_blank\">a top-secret mission for the Navy<\/a>  -- for which the <em>Titanic<\/em> was his cover story) <\/strong>and John F. Kennedy&#39;s <em>PT-109<\/em>. <\/p><p>His contributions to our scientific knowledge of the ocean is just as awe-inspiring. <strong>He was in the first team of humans to view the deep-sea vents<\/strong>, and to understand how life can not only survive but thrive in these deep black waters, under extreme pressure and at extreme temperature.  <\/p><p>He&#39;s also a powerful storyteller and <strong>a passionate scientific educator<\/strong>. He founded the Institute for Exploration and has pioneered distance learning in classrooms around the world.
