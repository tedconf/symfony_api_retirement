Subject: his own brain cancer","whylisten":"&quot;I have a brain cancer.&rdquo; Data artist and TED Fellow Salvatore Iaconesi posted these words on his website September 10, 2012. He wrote:<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><em>Yesterday I went to get my digital medical records: I have to show them to many doctors.<br \/>Sadly they were in a closed, proprietary format and, thus, I could not open them using my computer, or send them in this format to all the people who could have saved my life.<br \/>I cracked them.<br \/>I opened them and converted the contents into open formats, so that I could share them with everyone.<br \/><\/em>&nbsp;<br \/>In cracking his scans, X-rays, lab notes and charts, and opening them to the world, he laid out a model for open-sourcing not only a support group, but a whole cure (he calls it, in his native Italian, &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/artisopensource.net\/cure\" target=\"_blank\">La cura<\/a>&quot;). And he means a cure of any kind: &quot;There are cures for the body, for spirit, for communication.&quot; He had brain surgery in February 2013, &quot;and everything went perfectly.&quot; Now he is working on sharing the benefits of his experience.","slug":"salvatore_iaconesi","published_at":"2013-04-01 02:52:00","updated_at":"2015-07-16 15:47:36"}}
