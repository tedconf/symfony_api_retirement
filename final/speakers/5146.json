Throwing the rocket-building rulebook out the window, Beck&nbsp;and his team developed the world&#39;s first fully carbon-composite launch vehicle, powering it with 3D-printed, electric turbopump-fed engines. He also oversaw the development of the world&#39;s only private orbital launch site. In January 2018, Rocket Lab staged the first of many orbital launches.<\/p>","slug":"peter_beck","published_at":"2019-02-21 16:48:00","updated_at":"2019-11-12 15:42:29"}}
