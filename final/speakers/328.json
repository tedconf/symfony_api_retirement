Her work could pave the way for new, more potent medicine.","whylisten":"<p>In 2002, bearing her microscope on a microbe that lives in the gut of fish, Bonnie Bassler isolated an elusive molecule called AI-2, and uncovered the mechanism behind mysterious behavior called quorum sensing -- or bacterial communication. She showed that bacterial chatter is hardly exceptional or anomolous behavior, as was once thought -- and in fact, most bacteria do it, and most do it all the time. (She calls the signaling molecules &quot;bacterial Esperanto.&quot;)<br \/><br \/>The discovery shows how cell populations use chemical powwows to stage attacks, evade immune systems and forge slimy defenses called biofilms. For that, she&#39;s won a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant -- and is giving new hope to frustrated pharmacos seeking new weapons against drug-resistant superbugs.<br \/><br \/>Bassler teaches molecular biology at Princeton, where she continues her years-long study of V. harveyi, one such social microbe that is mainly responsible for glow-in-the-dark sushi. She also teaches aerobics at the YMCA.<\/p>","slug":"bonnie_bassler","published_at":"2009-04-08 01:00:00","updated_at":"2013-07-10 20:29:25"}}
