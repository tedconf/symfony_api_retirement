It was the biggest cross-border collaboration in journalism history. The Panama Papers resulted in resignations or political outcries in Britain, Iceland, Spain, Malta and Pakistan and triggered dozens of official inquires around the world. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Before joining as the ICIJ&#39;s first non-American director in September 2011, Ryle spent more than 25 years working as an investigative reporter, author and editor in Australia and in Ireland. He has more than 60 journalism awards from six countries, including honors from the George Polk Awards, Harvard University and the University of Liege. Reporters Without Borders has described his work with ICIJ as &quot;the future of investigative journalism worldwide.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p><p>(Photo: Le Monde \/ Melissa Golden)<\/p>","slug":"gerard_ryle","published_at":"2016-05-16 01:02:00","updated_at":"2016-07-20 15:15:26"}}
