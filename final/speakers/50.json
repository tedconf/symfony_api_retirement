Clarke told us, &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; So <strong>think of Keith Barry as a technologist, an elite software engineer of the human brain<\/strong>. Witty and direct, he celebrates human cleverness even while he&#39;s hacking it.<\/p><p>Barry&#39;s repertoire ranges from outrageous  stunts -- driving a car at full speed blindfolded -- to mind control, including hypnosis and mindreading. The Irish magician&#39;s relaxed style has made him an audience favorite worldwide, both in live shows and on his European television series, <em>Close Encounters with Keith Barry,<\/em> which aired in 28 countries. He&#39;s had specials on MTV and CBS, and tried his hand at acting as a murder suspect on <em>CSI: Miami. <\/em>There are rumors of a Las Vegas residency later in 2008.<\/p>","slug":"keith_barry","published_at":"2007-02-14 14:56:00","updated_at":"2019-08-14 15:37:34"}}
