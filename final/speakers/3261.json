She received her Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures from Harvard University in 2002, specializing in early modern Spanish literature.<\/p><p>In her scholarship and teaching, she became familiar with the discussions on spelling that took place in Spanish and other languages from as early as the 15th century to today. However, what ended up calling her attention to the spelling issue was the convergence of her academic awareness with other experiences. As a social media user, she noticed how spelling mistakes are frequently pointed out with unusual harshness and contempt. As a mother, she saw her children devote huge amounts of time to memorizing words and rules, in detriment to other aspects of language.<\/p>","slug":"karina_galperin","published_at":"2017-02-15 16:34:00","updated_at":"2017-03-16 14:52:34"}}
