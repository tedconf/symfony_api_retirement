Over the past 22 years, the Global Fund has provided more than 7,000 grants, reaching more than 3,000 groups. <strong>Since Ramdas took the reins, the fund&#39;s assets have more than tripled<\/strong> -- and so has the number of countries the group works in, now at 170. <\/p><p>The Global Fund for Women contributes to groups that improve women&#39;s economic security, work to end gender-based violence, increase access to education at all stages of life, provide critical health services and encourage women to take leadership roles in the public sector. In interviews, <strong>Ramdas has said that grantmakers can learn as much from applicants as applicants do from them<\/strong>. This is a philosophy she employs at Global Fund, where grants are often given with as few strings attached as possible, and proposals are accepted in any language. Her vision stands to change the game, not only in women&#39;s rights but in philanthropy as a whole.<\/p>","slug":"kavita_ramdas","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-13 18:46:35"}}
