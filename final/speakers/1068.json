He created his comic strip <em>You Can with Beakman &amp; Jax  <\/em>in 1991 for his local newspaper in Marin County, California -- inspired by a stint answering kids&#39; letters for Lucasfilm. The comic strip does not answer readers&#39; questions directly. Rather, it  gives directions to do a thing, a procedure, an experiment to learn the  answer. It&#39;s about learning by doing. Active. Not passive.<\/p>   <p>Six Beakman  &amp; Jax books are best-sellers. Church created the long-running TV series  <em>Beakman&#39;s World<\/em>, a hit in English and Spanish, and helped create the Beakman&#39;s World on Tour exhibit for science centers and museums. A longtime techie, he also served as the webmaster for artists <a href=\"http:\/\/christojeanneclaude.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Christo and Jeanne-Claude<\/a>. Church died April 29, 2016, and will be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beakmansworldtv.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">much missed<\/a>.<\/p>  <p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"jok_church","published_at":"2011-06-22 13:36:00","updated_at":"2016-05-02 17:30:42"}}
