But when he got the chance to go to school, he found a new mission -- to study and preserve the flora and fauna of his region, the Congo Basin forest. <strong>In his passion for the forest, Ewango found himself an unwitting hero<\/strong>, taking bold steps to secure its resources and convince warring parties to leave it in peace. <\/p><p>The Congo Basin&#39;s great forests are under pressure from many angles. Settlers look here for fresh farmland; miners look for deposits of valuable col-tan; and <strong>soldiers fight over the forests both as territory to be won and as a resource for bush meat<\/strong> (from the threatened okapi) and cooking charcoal. It&#39;s home to families of pygmies and herds of okapi -- and a treasure house of green, growing things. <\/p><p>Ewango won the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goldmanprize.org\/node\/101\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Environmental Prize<\/a>  in 2005 for his work at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unep-wcmc.org\/sites\/wh\/okapi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Okapi Faunal Reserve<\/a>  in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/718\" target=\"_blank\">World Heritage Site<\/a>.
