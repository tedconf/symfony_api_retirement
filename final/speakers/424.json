Meattle himself is a longtime activist for cleaning up India's air.","whylisten":"<p>Kamal Meattle has a vision to reshape commercial building in India using principles of green architecture and sustainable upkeep (including an air-cleaning system that involves <strong>massive banks of plants instead of massive banks of HVAC equipment<\/strong>). He started the Paharpur Business Centre and Software Technology Incubator Park (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pbcnet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">PBC-STIP<\/a>), in New Delhi, in 1990 to provide &quot;instant office&quot; space to technology companies. PBC-STIP&#39;s website publishes its air quality index every day, and tracks its compliance to the 10 principles of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unglobalcompact.org\/AbouttheGC\/TheTENPrinciples\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">UN Global Compact<\/a>, a corporate-citizenship initiative.<\/p><p>Meattle has long been a environmental activist in India. In the 1980s <strong>he helped India&#39;s apple industry develop less-wasteful packaging<\/strong> to help save acres of trees. He then began a campaign to help India&#39;s millions of scooter drivers use less oil. <a href=\"http:\/\/greenspaces.in\/\" target=\"_blank\">His next plan<\/a>  is to develop a larger version of PBC-STIP, making a green office accessible to more businesses in New Delhi and serving as an example of low-cost, low-energy office life. <\/p>","slug":"kamal_meattle","published_at":"2009-03-20 01:00:00","updated_at":"2019-08-12 21:13:47"}}
