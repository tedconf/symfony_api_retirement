Along the way Wolfe has discovered several new viruses, and is poised to discover many more. <\/p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in\">Wolfe&#39;s research has turned the field of epidemiology on its head, and attracted interest from philanthropists at Google.org and the Skoll foundation. Better still, the research opens the door to <strong>preventing epidemics before they happen<\/strong>, sidelining them via early-warning systems and alleviating the poverty from which easy transmission emerges. <\/p>","slug":"nathan_wolfe","published_at":"2008-03-26 22:00:00","updated_at":"2012-05-21 14:17:28"}}
