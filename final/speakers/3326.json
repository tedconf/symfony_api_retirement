Guided by algorithms, Nagpal&rsquo;s shockingly simple robots guide themselves into a variety of shapes -- an ability that, brought to scale, might lead to applications like disaster rescue, space exploration and beyond.<\/p>  <p>In addition to her work with biologically inspired robots, Nagpal helped create ROOT, a simple robot to teach coding to would-be programmers through a simple user interface suitable for students of all ages.<\/p>","slug":"radhika_nagpal","published_at":"2017-02-26 23:23:00","updated_at":"2017-09-19 15:24:01"}}
