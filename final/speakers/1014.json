He spent more than a decade there, rising into its leadership, until he was sentenced to four years in an Egyptian prison for belonging to the group. But he left prison feeling that Hizb ut-Tahrir was hijacking Islam for political purposes and that its aims were dangerously similar to the aims of fascism. While remaining a Muslim, he was no longer an Islamist.<br \/><br \/>His goal now is to help Muslims in the West engage in their current political frameworks, while encouraging non-Western Muslims to work for a democratic culture that values peace and women&rsquo;s rights. In the UK, he co-founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quilliamfoundation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Quilliam<\/a>, a think-tank that engages in &ldquo;counter-Islamist thought-generating&rdquo; -- looking for new narratives of citizenship, identity and belonging in a globalized world.<\/p><p>He says: &quot;I can now say that the more I learnt about Islam, the more tolerant I became.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"maajid_nawaz","published_at":"2011-05-21 10:06:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 18:23:23"}}
