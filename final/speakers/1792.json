In 2012 Pope&#39;s four-year-old brother, who had a passion for cooking, was beyond excited to ask for an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas. But, confused by the pink and purple colors and the television ads that only featured girls using the toy, he became discouraged.<\/p><p>Pope, thirteen at the time, was indignant that her brother should think any less of himself as a boy who liked to cook. Naturally Pope turned to the Internet. She posted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.change.org\/petitions\/hasbro-feature-boys-in-the-packaging-of-the-easy-bake-oven\" target=\"_blank\">a video and written petition<\/a> urging the CEO of Hasbro to change its marketing and packaging around the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.collectorsweekly.com\/articles\/easy-bake-evolution\/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy-Bake Oven<\/a>  to make it appealing to boys as well as girls.
