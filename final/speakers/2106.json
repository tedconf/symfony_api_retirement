Complex algorithms are increasingly used to make consequential decisions about us. Many of these decisions are subjective and have no right answer: who should be hired, fired or promoted; what news should be shown to whom; which of your friends do you see updates from; which convict should be paroled. With increasing use of machine learning in these systems, we often don&#39;t even understand how exactly they are making these decisions. Zeynep Tufekci studies what this historic transition means for culture, markets, politics and personal life.<\/p><p>Tufekci is a contributing opinion writer at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/column\/zeynep-tufekci\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New York Times<\/em><\/a>, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a faculty associate at Harvard&#39;s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.<\/p><p>Her book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Twitter-Tear-Gas-Fragility-Networked\/dp\/0300215126\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest<\/em><\/a>, was published in 2017 by Yale University Press.
