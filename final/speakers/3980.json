Between performances,&nbsp;Mafer Bandola (Venezuela), Lara Klaus (Brazil), Daniela Serna (Colombia) and Sara Lucas (US) uncovered a common dream of building communities through sound and empowering women and youth through music.<\/p><p>Reimagining South American and Caribbean styles like cumbia, maracatu, onda nueva and joropo and blending them with soul, R&amp;B and pop, LADAMA&nbsp;creates a new sound all their own. Together, the four shred on the bandola llanera from Venezuela, the tambor&nbsp;alegre from Colombia and the pandeiro from Northeastern Brazil. With powerful vocals, often accompanied by Pat Swoboda on the bass, LADAMA delivers a brand new musical experience. LADAMA flows from the electric to the acoustic, from Spanish to English and Portuguese, from the high plains of Venezuela to the Colombian coast. Their art proves that borders are meaningless, transporting us to a future where the world communicates across continents and cultures, through sound and story.<\/p>","slug":"ladama","published_at":"2018-02-17 15:39:00","updated_at":"2019-01-18 02:52:27"}}
