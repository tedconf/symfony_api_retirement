But Stuart Firestein says he&rsquo;s far more intrigued by what we don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Answers create questions,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We may commonly think that we begin with ignorance and we gain knowledge [but] the more critical step in the process is the reverse of that.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Firestein, who chairs the biological sciences department at Columbia University, teaches a course about how ignorance drives science. In it -- and in <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/ignorance\" target=\"_blank\">his 2012 book on the topic<\/a> -- he challenges the idea that knowledge and the accumulation of data create certainty. Facts are fleeting, he says; their real purpose is to lead us to ask better questions.<\/p>","slug":"stuart_firestein","published_at":"2013-01-06 02:09:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 17:50:09"}}
