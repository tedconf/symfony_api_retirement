As he says:<\/p><p><em>I am what can only be described as a cyborg  musician. &nbsp;in other words, the music i create live, can not be  replicated without technology. My music is called &quot;Beatjazz.&quot; It is a  mix of sound design, live looping and jazz improvisation. My  instrument of choice over the years has been a Yamaha Wind MIDI  controller, but now the limitations have started to stunt the growth of  this new form, so i designed an instrument that can take it into future.<\/em><\/p><p>He is now working on the next iteration of his instrument, codenamed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/tronbeatjazz\" target=\"_blank\">Tron<\/a>, and built around a helmet-mounted controller. <\/p>","slug":"onyx_ashanti","published_at":"2011-06-17 16:07:00","updated_at":"2011-07-20 16:01:02"}}
