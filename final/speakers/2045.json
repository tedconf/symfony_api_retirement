Rather, they should receive education, training and work, enabling them to triumph over their trauma and become agents of positive change and social transformation.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Fleming notes that more than 82 million people around the world have been forced to flee their homes. Among them are more than 26 million refugees, around half of whom are under the age of 18. But she believes that citing statistics to illustrate human suffering only leaves people numb.
