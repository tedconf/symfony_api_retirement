The result is a provocative, poignant read that shows why, far from being an irrelevant downtime, your twenties are a developmental sweetspot that comes only once. Your twenties are a time when the things you do -- and the things you don&#39;t do -- will have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come.<\/p><p>Jay is a clinical psychologist who specializes in adult development and in twentysomethings in particular. She is a clinical psychologist at the University of Virginia and maintains a private practice in Charlottesville. She spent her own early twentysomething years as an Outward Bound instructor.<\/p>","slug":"meg_jay","published_at":"2013-01-07 21:55:00","updated_at":"2021-06-01 14:59:06"}}
