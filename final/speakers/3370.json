Not choosing between these two sides is what perhaps gave him his first insight into the complexities of human identity. He is quoted as saying that all of his poetry and philosophy is based on what he calls &quot;the conversational nature of reality.&quot; His time as a scientist and naturalist fuide in the Galapagos Islands led him to explore what he calls the frontier nature of human identity. Whyte draws from this diverse background and a deep philosophical curiosity to craft poetry and prose that is at once highly relatable, yet altogether new. His work spans the worlds of literature, philosophy and organizational leadership, making him a clear, wise voice in an increasingly complex world.&nbsp;<\/p><p>His books include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1932887385\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1932887385&amp;linkId=f116b3c5a98462bbced2d3bab9efef67\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Sea in You: Twenty Poems of Requited and Unrequited Love<\/em><\/a>; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/159448435X\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=159448435X&amp;linkId=d78ae18c17036b249ba4115fa6b0305d\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Three Marriages: Reimagining Work, Self and Relationship<\/em><\/a>; <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00D8291B6\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00D8291B6&amp;linkId=63e5b8130e3f152ef2c2d27f4ec0c989\" target=\"_blank\">River Flow: New &amp; Selected Poems<\/a>;<\/em>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1932887342\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1932887342&amp;linkId=87c1f56a43f29457d2f848eba9fde52d\" target=\"_blank\">Consolations: The Solace, Nourishment and Underlying Meaning of Everyday Words<\/a>&nbsp;<\/em>and<em>&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pilgrim-David-Whyte\/dp\/1932887253\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pilgrim<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>","slug":"david_whyte","published_at":"2017-03-07 20:48:00","updated_at":"2017-08-23 20:42:11"}}
