More than 50 years later, he continues to investigate biology's deepest secrets. ","whylisten":"<p><strong>James Watson has led a long, remarkable life<\/strong>, starting at age 12, when he was one of radio&#39;s high-IQ Quiz Kids. By age 15, he had enrolled in the University of Chicago, and by 25, working with Francis Crick (and drawing, controversially, on the research of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin), he had made the discovery that would eventually win the three men the Nobel Prize. <\/p><p>Watson and Crick&#39;s 1953 discovery of DNA&#39;s double-helix structure paved the way for <strong>the astounding breakthroughs in genetics and medicine that marked the second half of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/time100\/scientist\/profile\/watsoncrick.html\" target=\"_blank\">20th century<\/a><\/strong>.
