{"speaker":{"id":264,"title":"","firstname":"Robert","middleinitial":"","lastname":"Lang","description":"Origamist","whotheyare":"Robert Lang merges mathematics with aesthetics to fold elegant modern origami. His scientific approach helps him make folds once thought impossible -- and has secured his place as one of the first great Western masters of the art. ","whylisten":"<p>Origami, as Robert Lang describes it, is simple: &quot;You take a creature, you combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.&quot; But Lang&#39;s own description belies the technicality of his art; indeed, <strong>his creations inspire awe by sheer force of their intricacy<\/strong>. His repertoire includes a snake with one thousand scales, a two-foot-tall allosaurus skeleton, and a perfect replica of a Black Forest cuckoo clock. Each work is the result of software (which Lang himself pioneered) that manipulates thousands of mathematical calculations in the production of a &quot;folding map&quot; of a single creature. <\/p><p>The marriage of mathematics and origami harkens back to Lang&#39;s own childhood.&nbsp; As a first-grader, Lang proved far too clever for elementary mathematics and quickly became bored, prompting his teacher to give him a book on origami. His acuity for mathematics would lead him to become a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, and the owner of nearly fifty patents on lasers and optoelectronics. <strong>Now a professional origami master, Lang practices his craft as both artist and engineer<\/strong>, one day folding the smallest of insects and the next the largest of space-bound telescope lenses.<\/p>","slug":"robert_lang","published_at":"2008-07-28 13:27:00","updated_at":"2009-04-21 11:35:14"}}
