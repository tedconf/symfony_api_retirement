Kristin Poinar studies how the meltwater forms and flows in this dynamic glacial system. She asks: How did this water get there, and where does it go? How much water is in there? And how is climate change affecting this system?<\/p><p>Using data from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/icebridge\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Operation IceBridge<\/a> flights and from field instruments, she&#39;s building a numerical model of how crevasses form and channel water. In fact, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/feature\/goddard\/2017\/new-pathway-for-greenland-meltwater-to-reach-ocean\" target=\"_blank\">NASA report released in February 2017<\/a> revealed a new pathway her team discovered for meltwater to reach the ocean. Using physically based models to constrain the bounds of what is realistic has shaped Poinar&#39;s interest in glaciology.<\/p><p>Poinar is currently a postdoctoral researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. She will be&nbsp;moving to the University at Buffalo in winter 2017 to be a professor in the Geology Department and the RENEW Institute.<\/p> ","slug":"kristin_poinar","published_at":"2017-03-18 21:47:00","updated_at":"2017-10-16 12:41:31"}}
