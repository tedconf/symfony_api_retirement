From 500,000-year-old actinobacteria in the Siberian permafrost a lone spruce standing on a mostly barren mountain in Sweden, her images capture both the robustness and fragility of life. While these organisms&#39; longevity dwarfs even that of human civilization, they all depend on ecosystems in fine balance -- a balance thrown into question by human encroachment and climate change.<br \/><br \/>Sussman&#39;s work has been exhibited throughout the United States and Europe in venues including the Museum of Natural History.<\/p>","slug":"rachel_sussman","published_at":"2010-06-17 06:50:00","updated_at":"2019-02-05 19:55:32"}}
