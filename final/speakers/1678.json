By changing the expression of certain genes in the fly brain, he generated smart flies that can learn many times faster than their peers. Using live imaging, he also detected learning-induced changes in the brain cells and observed memory formation inside the brain with light.<\/p>  <p>After graduation, he moved to MIT and joined Dr. Susumu Tonegawa&#39;s lab as a postdoctoral associate. He continued his pursuit of memory with light there. Instead of just watching memory formation, he developed a system in mice where one can not only identify and label cells in the brain for a particular memory, but also turn these cells on and off with light to activate this memory at will. This work was published in <em>Science<\/em> and has been covered by the media worldwide. Liu passed away in February 2015.<\/p>  ","slug":"xu_liu","published_at":"2013-08-15 13:32:00","updated_at":"2015-09-11 02:14:00"}}
