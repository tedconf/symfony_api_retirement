","whylisten":"<p>Established by Act of Parliament in 1753 as a museum for the world (and free to enter, down to this day), the British Museum has built a near-encyclopedic collection of art and artifacts representing the sweep of human history across 2 million years. In his 2010 radio series A History of the World in 100 Objects (accompanied by a splendid book with the same title), director Neil MacGregor showed how the artifacts and items we collect are a powerful tool for sharing our shared human narrative. <br \/><br \/>MacGregor has long been fascinated with the way museums can tell the world&#39;s story. At the British Museum, he&#39;s negotiated his way to mounting shows full of Chinese and Persian treasures, helping sometimes-prickly governments to share his mission of cultural togetherness. He was named Briton of the Year in 2008 by the Sunday Times, who said, &quot;He is a committed idealist who, in a world in which culture is increasingly presented as the acceptable face of politics, has pioneered a broader, more open, more peaceable way forward.&quot;<\/p><p>He says: &quot;That&rsquo;s what the museum is about: giving people their place in things.&rdquo;<\/p>","slug":"neil_macgregor","published_at":"2011-05-21 10:33:00","updated_at":"2012-02-20 16:38:35"}}
