Now as a PhD Candidate in mechanical engineering at MIT, Begg works on designs to improve any number of things in people&#39;s lives -- from <a href=\"http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/nikolai\/www\/portfolio\/Kinematic_S+P.html\" target=\"_blank\">salt and pepper shakers<\/a> that always stay in the same position relative to one another to a <a href=\"http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/nikolai\/www\/portfolio\/Female_Catheter.html\" target=\"_blank\">non-invasive female urinary catheter<\/a>. He&#39;s especially passionate about how he can apply physics and mechanical principles to medical devices. In 2013 he won the annual Lemelson-MIT Student Prize for Invention, for a product that makes <a href=\"http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/nikolai\/www\/portfolio\/Puncture_Access_Mechanism.html\" target=\"_blank\">more precise incisions<\/a> during surgery.","slug":"nikolai_begg","published_at":"2014-07-15 14:24:00","updated_at":"2014-07-15 14:51:01"}}
