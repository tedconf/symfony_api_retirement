But biologist Michael Dickinson views the sound with a deep sense of wonder.","whylisten":"        <p>Some things are so commonplace that they barely register our attention. Michael Dickinson has dedicated much of his research to one such thing -- the flight of the fly. Dickinson aims to understand how a fly&#39;s nervous system allows it to accomplish such incredible aerodynamic feats. Affectionately dubbed the &quot;Fly Guy&quot; by&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-scientist.com\/?articles.view\/articleNo\/32422\/title\/Fly-Guy\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Scientist<\/a>, Dickinson&#39;s research brings together zoology, neuroscience and fluid mechanics.<\/p> <p>Dickinson was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2001. He is now a professor of biology at the University of Washington, where he heads The Dickinson Lab. The lab conducts research into insect flight control, animal brain recordings, animal\/robot interactions and animal visual navigation and welcomes students with an interest in studying insect flight, behavior and evolution from an interdisciplinary approach perspective.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"michael_dickinson","published_at":"2013-02-22 01:34:00","updated_at":"2013-02-22 13:05:39"}}
