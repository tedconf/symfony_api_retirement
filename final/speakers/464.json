","whylisten":"<p>It started in 1997, when Alain de Botton turned away from writing novels and instead wrote a touching extended essay titled&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/proustchangeyourlife\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How Proust Can Change Your Life<\/em><\/a>, which became an unlikely blockbuster in the &quot;self-help&quot;category. His subsequent books take on some of the fundamental worries of modern life (am I happy? where exactly do I stand?), informed by his deep reading in philosophy and by a novelist&#39;s eye for small, perfect moments. His newest book is&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/pleasuressorrowswork\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work<\/em><\/a>. <br \/><br \/>In 2008, de Botton helped start the School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in today&#39;s uptight culture. His goal is (through any of his mediums) to help clients learn &quot;how to live wisely and well.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"alain_de_botton","published_at":"2009-07-28 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-09-21 21:40:30"}}
