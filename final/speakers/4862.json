Begum is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit Association for Behaviour &amp; Knowledge Transformation (ABKT), an organization working toward the economic and political empowerment of communities in underserved areas of Pakistan. Her organization was uprooted during the Taliban takeover in Swat due to massive displacement of people in 2009-2010. Against enormous odds, her resilience kept ABKT alive.<\/p><p>Begum previously worked with the UN Human Settlements Program as a consultant for the Building Gender Ladder Project as well as with UNDP&#39;s Women Political Participation Program. To encourage women at the grassroots level, she contested local elections in 2001 as an independent candidate and served as councilor for five years in Dir Lower. Begum is an Ashoka fellow, a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at National Endowment for Democracy and an Acumen Fellow. She won the US Department of State&#39;s International Woman of Courage Award in 2012.<\/p>","slug":"shad_begum","published_at":"2018-10-05 13:40:00","updated_at":"2019-01-28 16:42:15"}}
