Now, I get paid to write and tell stories that are by us, for everyone. As a father of two caramel-mocha skinned babies with multi-syllabic names, I often ask myself, &#39;What&#39;s my role as a parent? How do I protect my children from unique challenges and horrors they will have to face?&#39;&nbsp;<\/p><p>&quot;Even as the doubts and worries multiply, my wife and I still believe having kids was the best decision we ever made. Not only have they brought us considerable joy, but they have inspired me to try to fix as many of the problems we face today, so all of our children can emerge as the protagonists of an evolving American narrative.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"wajahat_ali","published_at":"2019-02-21 16:49:00","updated_at":"2022-02-24 15:25:36"}}
