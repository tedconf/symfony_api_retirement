As a girl I was inspired by Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian to go to space. I haven&#39;t made it to space yet, but I did become an explorer of a strange and exciting new world -- the quantum world of microscopic particles such as electrons and photons. I&#39;m a theoretical physicist who examines how the laws of quantum physics can be harnessed to transform computation and communication. My colleagues and I made the first-ever observations of cesium atoms that demonstrated a connection between chaos theory and quantum entanglement.<\/p><p>&quot;The activist in me questions why only three women have ever won the Nobel Prize in physics. I am passionate about addressing gender issues in science and recently founded the Laurier Centre for Women in Science, the first centre of its kind in Canada. I also work to create a vibrant and inclusive physics community in Canada as the vice president of the Canadian Association of Physicists. I love teaching and have co-authored Canada&#39;s largest selling introductory astronomy textbook.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"shohini_ghose","published_at":"2014-03-17 19:00:00","updated_at":"2018-12-20 21:19:53"}}
