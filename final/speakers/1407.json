After driving home, Morgan -- alongside sister Caitria -- took the reins of the relief effort. Working as lead volunteer coordinators, the two created a flexible framework for an &quot;unofficial&quot; community response. By leveraging the short term spike in national interest, along with social media and database organization, Monson recorded more volunteer hours than any surrounding town -- <em>hundreds<\/em> more hours, in fact. <\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">After this intense experience, Catria and Morgan have translated their system into organizing software for local coordinators, through the website <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recovers.org\" title=\"recovers.org\">Recovers.org<\/a>.&nbsp; This &ldquo;recovery in a box&rdquo; can be rolled out in minutes, helping local relief organizers turn interest into action.
