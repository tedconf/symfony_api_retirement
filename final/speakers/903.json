What are the algorithms that allow useful sensorimotor routines and behaviors to be learned? What computational mechanisms allow the brain to adapt to changing circumstances and remain fault-tolerant and robust? <\/p><p> By investigating these questions within a computational and probabilistic framework, it is often possible to derive algorithms that not only provide functional interpretations of neurobiological properties but also suggest solutions to difficult problems in computer vision, speech, robotics and artificial intelligence.<\/p><p>Watch Rao&#39;s TEDxBerkeley 2020 talk, &quot;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DH5HBQD69oI \" target=\"_blank\">Brain Co-Processors-When AI Meets the Brain<\/a>.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"rajesh_rao","published_at":"2010-12-19 19:05:00","updated_at":"2020-04-21 13:28:19"}}
