In the process, he&rsquo;s discovered a complex internal ecology that affects everything from weight loss to our susceptibility to disease. As he said to <em>Nature<\/em> in 2012, &quot;What motivates me, from a pragmatic standpoint, is how understanding the microbial world might help us improve human and environmental health.&rdquo; <br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Knight&rsquo;s recent projects include the American Gut, an attempt to map the unique microbiome of the United States using open-access data mining tools and citizen-scientists to discover how lifestyle and diet affect our internal flora and fauna, and our overall health.<\/p><p>Knight is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/followyourgutintl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Follow Your Gut: The Enormous Impact of Tiny Microbes<\/em><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"rob_knight","published_at":"2014-01-24 07:40:00","updated_at":"2017-05-11 15:00:01"}}
