MIT researcher Nancy Kanwisher seeks to answer this question by discovering a &ldquo;parts list&rdquo; for the human mind and brain. &quot;Understanding the nature of the human mind,&quot; she <a href=\"http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/bcs\/nklab\/media\/pdfs\/Kanwisher.PNAS2010.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says<\/a>, &quot;is arguably the greatest intellectual quest of all time.&quot;<\/p>  <p>Kanwisher and her colleagues have used fMRI to identify distinct sites in the brain for face recognition, knowing where you are, and thinking about other people&rsquo;s thoughts. Yet these discoveries are a prelude to bigger questions: How do these brain regions develop and function? What are the actual computations that go on in each region, and how are these computations implemented in circuits of neurons? And how do these work together to produce human intelligence?<br \/><br \/>To learn more, see <a href=\"http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/bcs\/nklab\/nancysbraintalks\/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Kanwisher&#39;s collection of short talks<\/a>   on how scientists actually study the human mind and brain and what they have learned so far.<\/p>","slug":"nancy_kanwisher","published_at":"2014-01-24 21:27:00","updated_at":"2014-10-02 15:03:59"}}
