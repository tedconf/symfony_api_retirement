Whether learning to cook rice from Gurkhas or spending time alongside a garageful of car repairmen in Borneo, Stone quickly learned that nontraditional problem-solving was often the very best kind.<\/p><p>At 20, Stone moved to Australia and eventually to the outback, where she was soon herding 22,000 sheep on a 120,000-acre farm. She then returned to England and began her studies in electronics at Salford University, before being recruited to do her PhD work in physics at Cambridge&#39;s Cavendish Laboratory, where her focus on moving electrons eventually led to the creation of her groundbreaking company, <a href=\"http:\/\/novalia.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Novalia<\/a>.<\/p><p>At Novalia, Stone says: &quot;The work of my team and myself is the realization of my childhood fascinations. We put electronics into paper, and paper is all around us.&quot; Stone sees herself as a &quot;creative scientist,&quot; blending art and science to create startling fusions of new and old technology.
