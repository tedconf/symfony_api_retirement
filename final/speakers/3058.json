You see the considerable value of its interconnectedness. You develop an instinctive mistrust for simplistic solutions and ideas and you start embracing complexity and unorthodox ways to think it and tame it.<\/p><p>As the director of global strategy for healthcare logistics at UPS, Kabbaj finds ways for organizations to transport their temperature-sensitive medicines and biotechnologies safely around the world. For more than 18 years, Kabbaj&#39;s professional engagements have always revolved around globalization, transportation and innovation. Some of his ventures involved helping EADS Astrium use its satellite space transportation expertise in unexpected markets or participating in the global launch of Logan, a revolutionary low-cost vehicle, that helped Renault-Nissan harness a surprising growth in emerging markets.<\/p><p>Kabbaj is a dual citizen of Morocco and France and lived in four continents. Experiencing constant cultural transitions throughout his life gave him a real taste for analyzing problems through non-traditional lenses and blending disciplines that are usually kept separate.<\/p>","slug":"wanis_kabbaj","published_at":"2016-09-14 15:26:00","updated_at":"2018-11-06 16:21:51"}}
