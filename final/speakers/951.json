But an inspiring stuffed-monkey-shot-from-a-cannon demonstration and a series of positive research experiences as an undergraduate propelled him to graduate school at UCSB.<br \/><br \/>While there, in an experiment remarkable both for its conceptual simplicity and technical difficulty, O&rsquo;Connell was the first person to measure quantum effects in an object large enough to see with the naked eye. Named Breakthrough of the year by <em>Science Magazine<\/em>, the experiment shattered the previous record for the largest quantum object, showing decisively that there is no hard line between the quantum and everyday worlds.<\/p>","slug":"aaron_o_connell","published_at":"2011-02-16 21:46:00","updated_at":"2011-06-24 15:10:05"}}
