Jones is a life-long student of human nature, fascinated most by the decision-making capacity intrinsic to each of us.","whylisten":"<p>Kevin B. Jones diagnoses and performs surgeries to remove rare cancers called sarcomas from the limbs of children and adults. Counseling patients -- especially teenagers with bone cancers -- about the decisions they must make with regard to their bodies has brought the uncertainties of medicine into keen focus for him. How does a person decipher what medicine has told her? How can a person choose among options given very limited understanding of the implications of each? Intrigued by these riddles and conundrums that patient-physician communication frequently creates, Jones wrote a book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/9e9e4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What Doctors Cannot Tell You: Clarity, Confidence and Uncertainty in Medicine<\/em><\/a>.<\/p><p>Jones also runs a scientific research laboratory focused on the biology of sarcomas. Here, his team studies the decisions cells make on the way to becoming a cancer. Again the complexities and uncertainties inherent to these decisions are in full relief.<\/p><p>Jones sees patients and does surgery as an associate professor at the University of Utah in the Department of Orthopaedics, working at both Primary Children&#39;s Hospital and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. His laboratory is in the Huntsman Cancer Institute, where he is an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Oncological Sciences.<\/p><p>Jones studied English literature at Harvard, medicine at Johns Hopkins, orthopedic surgery at the University of Iowa, and musculoskeletal oncology at the University of Toronto. He lives in Salt Lake City with his wife and four children.<\/p>","slug":"kevin_jones","published_at":"2016-12-05 22:13:00","updated_at":"2016-12-12 16:13:50"}}
