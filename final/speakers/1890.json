","whylisten":"<p>When <a href=\"http:\/\/ruthchang.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruth Chang<\/a> graduated from college, she was presented with a choice: Should she pursue a career in philosophy, or a career in law? Soon after finishing Harvard Law School and dipping her toe in the legal world, she regretted her decision and switched paths. She went off to Oxford University to study philosophy and has been a philosopher studying choice, freedom, value and action ever since.  <\/p><p>Chang&#39;s research focuses on decision-making and the human condition: How do we exercise our freedom through the choices we make?
