That burst in population has been accompanied by a huge surge in water consumption. So what&#39;s so strange about that? -- Qatar has virtually no water. In comparison to Brazil&#39;s annual 1782 mm of rain, Qatar&#39;s annual rainfall is 74 mm. <\/p><p>Al-Attiya is the Chairman of Qatar&rsquo;s National Food Security Programme, and he is tasked with making food secure -- and keeping it that way -- in a place that has no water and imports 90 percent of its food. He hopes that his program&#39;s innovations in sustainable agriculture, especially in arid regions, can help other countries deal with dwindling food supplies due to extreme climate change.<\/p>","slug":"fahad_al_attiya","published_at":"2013-01-30 23:38:00","updated_at":"2013-01-31 16:02:03"}}
