Al Jazeera&#39;s approach to journalism emphasizes &quot;re-thinking authority, giving a voice to the voiceless,&quot; Khanfar said in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/world\/article\/0,8599,1559468,00.html#ixzz1FT91mLH9\" target=\"_blank\">an interview with TIME<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>No news network has attracted as much controversy as Al Jazeera. Khanfar, in turn, became the lightning rod for dispute on the organization&#39;s place in politics, both in its home region and abroad.
