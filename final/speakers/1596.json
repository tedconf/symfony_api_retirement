At the Centre for clinical brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Siddharthan Chandran works in the emerging discipline of regenerative neurology -- exploring how injured or damaged neurons in the brain might actually be repaired.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>His research strategy uses MS and motor neuron disease (ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#39;s diesease) as primary disease models, combining laboratory and clinical activity to study&nbsp; brain injury, neurodegeneration and repair, using stem cells to model and test. His work, he says, &quot;reflects the complexity of the brain. You can replace a kidney, but not a brain. One must remain careful and humble in the face of current knowledge.&quot; He is also director of the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic.<\/p>","slug":"siddharthan_chandran","published_at":"2013-03-31 23:56:00","updated_at":"2014-02-24 16:05:23"}}
