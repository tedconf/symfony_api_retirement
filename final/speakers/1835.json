Born in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, into a Muslim-Christian family, Bakhtiozina studied and worked in London in graphic design and photography before settling on her unique style which mixes folklore, history, fashion and challenging stereotypes. Calling her style &quot;Tatar Baroque,&quot; in part because she is half Tatar, Bakhtiozina has a&nbsp;passion for irregularity, and she says that her work documents dreams. Bakhtiozina&nbsp;creates everything inside her analogue photography and films, from outfits to stages, to fulfill the story behind each of her creations. None of her works have been digitally manipulated.<\/p>","slug":"uldus_bakhtiozina","published_at":"2014-03-17 20:57:00","updated_at":"2017-10-19 14:43:01"}}
