For UNEP, his &ldquo;Green Economy Report&rdquo; synthesized years of research to show, with real numbers, that environmentally sound development is not a bar to growth but rather a new engine for growing wealth and creating employment in the face of persistent poverty. The groundbreaking TEEB (formally &ldquo;The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity&rdquo;) report counts the global economic benefits of biodiversity. It encourages countries to develop and publish &ldquo;Natural capital accounts&rdquo; tracking the value of plants, animal, water and other &ldquo;natural wealth&rdquo; alongside traditional financial measures in the hope of changing how decisions are made. In his book, Corporation 2020, he envisions tomorrow&rsquo;s corporations as agents of an inclusive, green economy. He is now the CEO of Gist Advisory, a sustainability consulting firm.<\/p>","slug":"pavan_sukhdev","published_at":"2011-05-21 10:43:00","updated_at":"2016-06-03 19:29:47"}}
