In response, Missmahl founded the psychosocial Project Kabul for Caritas Germany, a project that trained Afghan men and women to offer psychosocial counseling in 15 centers throughout the city. <\/p><p>The project has offered free treatment to 12,000 clients to date, <strong>helping to restore self-determination and well-being while breaking down ingrained gender barriers and social stigma of mental illness<\/strong>. Psychosocial counseling is now integrated in the Afghan health system thanks to Missmahl&#39;s efforts. She now works on behalf of the European Union as Technical Advisor for Mental Health for the Afghan government, and is founder of International Psychosocial Organisation (IPSO), a network of experts dedicated to developing and implementing psychosocial programs in various contexts.<\/p>","slug":"inge_missmahl","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2010-09-29 12:20:40"}}
