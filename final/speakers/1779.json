A powered ankle-foot prosthesis called the Empower by Ottobock, for instance, emulates the action of a biological leg to create a natural gait, allowing persons with amputation to walk with normal levels of speed and metabolism as if their legs were biological.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Herr also advances powerful body exoskeletons that augment human physicality beyond innate physiological levels, enabling humans to walk and run faster with less metabolic energy. He is the co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Dephy Inc., which creates products that augment physiological function through electromechanical enhancement.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"hugh_herr","published_at":"2014-01-27 15:24:00","updated_at":"2018-05-18 19:26:34"}}
