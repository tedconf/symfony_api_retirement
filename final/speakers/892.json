Formerly a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow at Los Alamos National    Laboratory before joining Tufts, his research is focused on    interdisciplinary themes that span nonlinear optics, nanostructured    materials (such as photonic crystals and photonic crystal fibers),    optofluidics and biopolymer based photonics. He has published over 100    papers and peer-review contributions across these various disciplines.<\/p><p>Since moving to Tufts at the end of 2005, he has proposed and pioneered    (with David Kaplan) the use of silk as a material platform for    photonics, optoelectronics and high-technology applications. This new    research platform has recently been featured in MIT&#39;s <em>Technology    Review<\/em> as one of the 2010 &quot;top ten technologies likely    to change the world.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"fiorenzo_omenetto","published_at":"2010-12-18 21:20:00","updated_at":"2011-05-10 14:46:38"}}
