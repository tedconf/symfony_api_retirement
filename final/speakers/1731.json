He is the cofounder of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\">Open Explorer<\/a>, a digital field journal for researchers, citizen scientists and explorers.<\/p><p>in 2010, Lang and NASA engineer Eric Stackpole went looking for lost gold (literally) in an underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierra Navada. But they weren&#39;t quite sure how to go about it. Without much expertise (or money), the two put initial designs for an underwater robot explorer online. Soon <a href=\"http:\/\/openrov.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenROV<\/a>  was born: a community of citizen ocean explorers who build and constantly improve upon these small remote operated underwater robots.<\/p><p>Lang is also the author of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.zerotomaker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Zero to Maker<\/a><\/em> and a 2013 TED Fellow. He lives on a sailboat in the San Francisco Bay.<\/p>","slug":"david_lang","published_at":"2013-12-04 18:23:00","updated_at":"2018-10-15 19:53:54"}}
