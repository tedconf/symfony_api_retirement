Through his Dikika Research Project (DRP) in the Afar desert of Ethiopia, he has discovered <strong>the earliest known skeleton of a hominid child<\/strong>, the 3.3-million-year-old bones of Selam, a 3-year-old girl of the species <em>Australopithecus afarensis.<\/em> She is a member of the same species as Lucy, discovered nearby in 1974.<\/p><p>In studying Selam&#39;s tiny bones, Alemseged is searching for<strong> the points at which we humans diverged from apes<\/strong>. For instance, Selam may have had ape-like shoulders, made for climbing trees -- but her legs were angled for walking upright. Her young brain, at age 3, was still growing, which implies that she was set to have a long human-style childhood. And in the hyoid bone of her throat, Alemseged sees <strong>the beginning of human speech<\/strong>.<br \/> <\/p><p>Born in Axum, Ethiopia, Alemseged is based in San Francisco at the&nbsp;California Academy of Sciences&nbsp;where is is the Director and Curator of the Anthropology department. Prior to this, he was a senior researcher at the &nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eva.mpg.de\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology<\/a>  in Leipzig.
