His projects call attention to social, environmental and political issues, while raising chuckles from passersby.","whylisten":"<p>Mundano is a Brazilian street artist and activist whose work makes people stop and think about the issues swirling around them everyday. In 2007, he began using his graffiti skills to paint &quot;carro&ccedil;as,&quot;&nbsp;the wooden and metal carts used by the trash collectors throughout Brazil who haul off junk and recyclables. He painted 200&nbsp;carro&ccedil;as and in the process made these invisible superheroes visible&mdash;not only in the streets, but also in the media.&nbsp;The effort led to &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pimpmycarroca.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pimp My Carro&ccedil;a<\/a>,&quot; which made this initiative do-it-yourself, crowdfunded and global. It has brought in 170 trash collectors in cities around the world, teaming them up with 200 street artists and 800 volunteers. It is quickly becoming a movement.<\/p> <p>At home in Brazil, Mundano works on other projects too. Since 2008, he has used the posters and banners that plaster Brazilian cities during elections to create thought-provoking art. For the election in 2014, he turned these enormous plastic banners into a giant voting booth filled with waste in a square in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;I use these ads to get people to reflect on the corrupted political system. On all the false promises, and all the awful waste,&quot; he explains.<\/p>","slug":"mundano","published_at":"2014-12-19 15:46:00","updated_at":"2014-12-19 15:54:29"}}
