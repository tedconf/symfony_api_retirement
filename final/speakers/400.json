But rather than focusing on the obvious Orwellian aspects of these looming changes, Cascio suggests that the rapid democratization of these technologies will be empowering rather than enslaving.<\/p> <p>After acting as the co-founder of WorldChanging.com, Cascio has, since 2006, made his online home at <a href=\"http:\/\/openthefuture.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenTheFuture.com<\/a>. Recently, he was part of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.superstructgame.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Superstruct<\/a>, part of the Institute for the Future&#39;s 2009 Ten-Year Forecast. He&#39;s now working on a set of 50-year scenarios that will serve as framing material for the TYF &amp; Superstruct content. He&#39;s also at work on a book on the use of <strong>foresight as a way of dealing with periods of significant uncertainty and change<\/strong>.<\/p>","slug":"jamais_cascio","published_at":"2009-01-21 08:38:00","updated_at":"2009-01-21 15:18:44"}}
