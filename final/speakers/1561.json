Unlike in the past, though, the course enrolled 155,000 students from 162 countries around the world.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>It was the inaugural offering of what is now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">edX<\/a> , an online learning venture of MIT and Harvard, which Agarwal helms. Through this nonprofit -- one of the leading forces of the massive open online course (MOOC) movement -- Agarwal aims to make higher education globally available, for free.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Which does not preclude in-person education. On campus, Agarwal is pushing for what he calls blended courses, which interweave digital content and face-to-face interactions. &quot;I see online learning as a rising tide that will lift all boats,&rdquo; Agarwal says. <\/p><p>Agarwal holds the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guinnessworldrecords.com\/records-3000\/largest-microphone-array\/\" target=\"_blank\">Guinness World Record<\/a>  for the largest microphone array, and was named one of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/lists\/2012\/impact\/anant-agarwal.html\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes&#39; top education innovators<\/a>  in 2012.
