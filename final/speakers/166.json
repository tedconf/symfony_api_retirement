And perhaps they are the best way to encapsulate the Mali-born singer&rsquo;s strength throughout her nearly twenty-year musical path, which includes a gorgeous performance at TEDGlobal 2007<em>.<\/em> <\/p><p>Having grown up as a diplomat&rsquo;s child, Rokia had always been a traveller; but in 2009, she decided to move home to Mali. Three years later, she was the witness to a terrible war. &ldquo;Experiencing life in a war-torn country was traumatic. I became aware of how naive I had been,&rdquo; she confesses. &quot;It&rsquo;s never easy to go through tough times, but it is also what makes you grow.&rdquo;  The art of picking yourself up is what <em>N&eacute; So<\/em> is all about. Rokia Traor&eacute; started by writing and composing the songs alone. She then rehearsed in Bamako and recorded in Brussels and Bristol with musicians auditioned from the entire West African region -- as she says, &ldquo;I need difference, I need a mix of cultures around me.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"rokia_traore","published_at":"2008-03-27 01:54:00","updated_at":"2019-01-28 18:34:52"}}
