In the 1960s, while working in Africa on the interrelated problems of increasing poverty and disappearing wildlife, Savory made a significant breakthrough in understanding the degradation and desertification of grassland ecosystems. After decades of study and collaboration, thousands of managers of land, livestock and wildlife on five continents today follow the methodology he calls &quot;Holistic Management.&quot;<br \/><br \/>In 1992, Savory and his wife, Jody Butterfield, formed the <a href=\"http:\/\/achmonline.squarespace.com\" target=\"_blank\">Africa Centre for Holistic Management<\/a>  in Zimbabwe, a learning site for people all over Africa. In 2010, the Centre won the Buckminster Fuller Challenge for its work in reversing desertification. In that same year he and his wife, with others, founded the <a href=\"http:\/\/savoryinstitute.com\" target=\"_blank\">Savory Institute<\/a>&nbsp;in Boulder, Colorado, to promote large-scale restoration of the world&#39;s grasslands.<\/p><p>Intrigued by this talk?
