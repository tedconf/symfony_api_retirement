After eight years of implementing the practice in San Jose, Raj Jayadev and the De-Bug team have gone on to train community organizations across the country to become participatory defense hubs. There is now a National Participatory Defense Network that De-Bug coordinates, which represents hubs from more than 30 cities. Jayadev&rsquo;s community organizing and writings have been featured in the <em>New York Times<\/em>, <em>The Atlantic<\/em>, BBC, <em>TIME<\/em> Magazine and media outlets across the country.
