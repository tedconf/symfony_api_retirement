Given excessive or insufficient blood vessel growth, serious health issues arise. While researching under Harvard surgeon Judah Folkman, who pioneered the study of angiogenesis, Li learned how angiogenesis-based medicine helps patients overcome numerous diseases by restoring the balance of blood-vessel growth.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Li co-founded the Angiogenesis Foundation in 1994. The foundation&rsquo;s Project ENABLE -- a global system that integrates patients, medical experts and healthcare professionals -- democratizes the spread and implementation of knowledge about angiogenesis-based medicines, diet and lifestyle. Some 40,000 physicians have been educated on new treatments, ranging from cancer care to wound care, by the foundation&rsquo;s faculty of medical experts, and they are bringing new, lifesaving and disease-preventing techniques to people around the world.<\/p>","slug":"william_li","published_at":"2009-12-09 14:32:00","updated_at":"2010-05-17 09:02:31"}}
