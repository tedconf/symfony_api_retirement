He is at the forefront of defining new parameters for art.","whylisten":"<p>Having worked as an academic at MIT and a researcher specializing in computer technology and software engineering, Golan Levin now spends most of his time working as a performance artist. Rest assured his education hasn&#39;t gone to waste, however, as Levin <strong>blends high tech and customized software programs to create his own extraordinary audio and visual compositions<\/strong>. The results are inordinately experimental sonic and visual extravaganzas from the furthest left of the field. <\/p><p>Many of his pieces force audience participation, such as <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flong.com\/telesymphony\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dialtones: A Telesymphony<\/a>,<\/em> <strong>a concert from 2001 entirely composed of the choreographed ringtones of his audience<\/strong>. Regularly exhibiting pieces in galleries around the world, and also working as an Assistant Professor of Electronic Time-Based Art at Carnegie Mellon University, Levin is unapologetically pushing boundaries to define a brave new world of what is possible.<\/p><p>His latest piece, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flong.com\/projects\/snout\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Double-Taker (Snout)<\/em><\/a>, is installed at the Pittsburg Museum of Art.<\/p>","slug":"golan_levin","published_at":"2007-02-13 11:06:00","updated_at":"2009-04-08 15:01:07"}}
