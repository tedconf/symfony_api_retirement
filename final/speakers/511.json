","whylisten":"<p>During the twin tragedies of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, Ipswich water-treatment expert Michael Pritchard winced helplessly at televised coverage of throngs of refugees waiting for days for a simple drink of clean water. Stricken by the chronic failure of aid agencies to surmount this basic challenge, Pritchard decided to do something about it. <br \/><br \/>Using a non-chemical nano-filtration hollow fiber membrane with 15 nanometer pores (it is designed to block viruses), the Lifesaver bottle can make the most revolting swamp water drinkable in seconds. Better still, a single long-lasting filter can clean 6,000 liters of water. Given the astronomical cost of shipping water to disaster areas, Pritchard&#39;s Lifesaver bottle could turn traditional aid models on their heads.<\/p> ","slug":"michael_pritchard","published_at":"2009-08-04 01:00:00","updated_at":"2009-08-07 13:44:24"}}
