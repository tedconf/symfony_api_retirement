He has worked on real-time analysis of COVID-19, influenza, dengue fever and Zika outbreaks. His research has provided new insights into how Zika spread prior to the Latin American epidemic, what factors influenced the early dynamics of COVID-19, and how social behavior can shape influenza outbreaks. His popular science articles have appeared in publications including <em>The Observer<\/em>, <em>Financial Times<\/em>, <em>Wired<\/em> and <em>Scientific American<\/em>. Currently, Kucharski is developing new ways to extract reliable insights about disease transmission from unreliable surveillance data.
