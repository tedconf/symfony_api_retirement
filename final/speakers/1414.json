As a student activist, Bandi suffered persecution and fled the country, seeking political asylum in the U.K. But Mbubi has kept his home country on his radar, noting how the mining of tantalum -- a mineral used in cell phones and computers -- has fueled the ongoing war there in which 5 million have died.<\/p>  <p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Mbubi sees the cell phone as an instrument of oppression for this reason, he knows that phones can also bring great freedom.
