As Managing Director of McLaren Electronics, which provides electronics and data collection software to motorsports events, he and his team work in real time during a race to improve cars on about 500 different parameters. That&#39;s about 750 million data points in two hours.<\/p><p>But recently van Manen and his team have been wondering: Why can&#39;t the extremely precise and subtle data-collection and analysis systems used in motorsports be applied elsewhere, for the benefit of all? They have applied their systems to ICU units at Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital with real-time analysis that allows them to proactively prevent cardiac arrests. The unit has seen a 25 percent decrease in life-threatening events. And it&#39;s just the beginning.<\/p>","slug":"peter_van_manen","published_at":"2013-08-01 14:37:00","updated_at":"2013-08-01 15:07:29"}}
