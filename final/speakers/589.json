His puzzles have appeared inside video games such as <em>Obsidian<\/em>, in browser games like <em>Bejeweled<\/em>, and in his regular monthly column, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scottkim.com\/discover\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Boggler<\/a>, in <a href=\"http:\/\/discovermagazine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Discover Magazine<\/em><\/a>.<br \/><br \/>Kim&#39;s interest in puzzles sprang from an early interest in mathematics, education and art. He specializes in ambigrams, or inversions: for example, a word that reads more than one way. His first puzzles appeared in <em>Scientific American<\/em> in Martin Gardner&#39;s Mathematical Games column, and are now included in many different books, toys and games. His games can also be played on his&nbsp;website&nbsp;or found on greeting cards. Kim&#39;s 1981 book, <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/3cnm\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Inversions<\/em><\/a>, features a collection of &quot;inversions&quot; -- a word or name written so it reads in more than one way. His second book contains a collection of his puzzles originally submitted to magazines and is entitled&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/9fg\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New Media Puzzle Workout<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"scott_kim","published_at":"2009-12-04 08:54:00","updated_at":"2015-10-09 21:40:07"}}
