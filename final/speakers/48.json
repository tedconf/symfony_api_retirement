He is a proponent of the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics, which has the startling implication that every physically possible event exists somewhere within an infinite fabric of coexisting universes.<\/p><p>He is the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/gWG1wVq\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Beginning of Infinity<\/em><\/a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/OctuI\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Fabric of Reality<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"david_deutsch","published_at":"2007-02-14 11:25:00","updated_at":"2019-10-14 13:59:36"}}
