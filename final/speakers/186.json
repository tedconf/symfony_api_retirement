Alison Jackson knows why. And she photographs the people you think you recognize doing what you really want to see.","whylisten":"<p>Recognizing the deep-seated need of the world public to see the Queen mum seated at the toilet, Elton John getting a colonic, and Keith Richards ironing his knickers, Alison Jackson set out to create the images that we really want paparazzi to capture. Armed with cheap photographic equipment, celebrity look-alikes, and a canny sense of what we think people are doing when we&#39;re not looking, she creates images that are equal parts belly laughs and pure scandal.<br \/><br \/>Jackson&#39;s newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/2S2i\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Alison Jackson: Confidential<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;features over 300 of her images in outrageous succession. She is also the auteur behind the popular BBC series &quot;Double Take,&quot; which focuses on the (fake) outrageous behavior of dozens of popular British political, entertainment, and sports figures. Her biggest frustration is the penchant of her doppelgangers&#39; real life subjects to take on behavior more outrageous than her photographs.<\/p>","slug":"alison_jackson","published_at":"2008-01-28 01:29:00","updated_at":"2015-10-10 02:01:57"}}
