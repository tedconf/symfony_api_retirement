Behind his energizing musicianship (often featuring unusual instruments like \"the paper bag\") is a deep love of hidden Appalachian wisdom and storytelling that shines on every stage he takes. ","whylisten":"<p>As a youngster, David Holt knew he wanted to master the banjo. His quest to that end brought him <strong>into the tucked-away communities of the remote Appalachian Mountains<\/strong>, where traditional folk music is still ingrained in the way of life. In his years there, he met some too-enchanting-to-be-true characters and a few local living legends (Wade Mainer, Dellie Norton) -- complete with anecdotes from older and harder times. He also picked up some unusual musical skills beyond the banjo: he&#39;s now a virtuoso of the mouth bow, the bottleneck slide guitar and the paper bag.<\/p><p>Holt has won four Grammys and has starred in several radio and television programs, such as Folkways, which visits regional craftsmen and musicians. (He also performed in the 2000 film, <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?<\/em>.) He currently tours the country doing solo performances, and accompanied by his band The Lightning Bolts.<\/p>","slug":"david_holt","published_at":"2008-12-07 21:17:00","updated_at":"2009-02-22 07:09:04"}}
