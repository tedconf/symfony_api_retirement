With its Lucite lines, lush green interior and rounded corners, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mathieulehanneur.fr\/projet_gb.php?projet=90\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea purifier<\/a>  featured in the exhibit resembles a mash-up of a terrarium and an iMac, but its function is less visible. Inspired by NASA research and designed by Lehanneur and partner David Edwards so that the plants in it metabolize the micro-toxins in the air, it&#39;s nothing less than a domestic breathing machine. <br \/><br \/>Though he&#39;s inspired by nature, Lehanneur isn&#39;t interested in biomimicry, but rather in the symbiosis between living and synthetic materials, often to solve environmental problems. Lehanneur&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mathieulehanneur.fr\/projet_gb.php?projet=127\" target=\"_blank\">Local River<\/a>, at first glance a large aquarium-cum-herb garden, is in fact designed to be an indoor food farm, with the locavore in mind. He also integrates technology into his designs for commercial products such as Binauric&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mathieulehanneur.fr\/projet_gb.php?projet=194\" target=\"_blank\">Boom Boom speakers<\/a> and Lexon&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mathieulehanneur.fr\/projet_gb.php?projet=192#\" target=\"_blank\">Take Time watch<\/a>.<\/p> ","slug":"mathieu_lehanneur","published_at":"2009-06-25 12:49:00","updated_at":"2014-08-12 18:13:23"}}
