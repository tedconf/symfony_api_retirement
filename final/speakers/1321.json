His unique experience of color informs his artwork &mdash; which, until he met cyberneticist Adam Montandon at a college lecture, was strictly black-and-white. By working with Montandon, and later with Peter Kese, Harbisson helped design a lightweight eyepiece that he wears on his forehead that transposes the light frequencies of color hues into sound frequencies.<\/p>  <p>Harbisson&#39;s artwork blurs the boundaries between sight and sound. In his&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JDqL-PUZ148\" target=\"_blank\">Sound Portraits<\/a>&nbsp;series, he listens to the colors of faces to create a microtonal chord. In the City Colours project, he expresses the capital cities of Europe in two colors (Monaco is azure and salmon pink; Bratislava yellow and turquoise).<\/p>","slug":"neil_harbisson","published_at":"2012-04-30 18:38:00","updated_at":"2012-07-20 14:56:04"}}
