He's chair of Linden Labs, the company behind the digital society.","whylisten":"<p>A tinkerer since childhood and an entrepreneur since he was a teenager, Philip Rosedale was always captivated with the idea of simulated reality and imaginary environments. He worked as CTO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realnetworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">RealNetworks<\/a>  until computing technology caught up with his fancies. Then he founded Linden Labs and <strong>built a virtual civilization called Second Life<\/strong>. That environment now boasts milions of citizens and a buzzing economy (currency: Linden dollars) that represents over $10 million in real value.<\/p><p>Second Life may be artificial but it&#39;s hardly trivial, Rosedale says. Its appeal to human creativity is obvious, but beyond the<strong> thriving in-world industries and bustling social spaces<\/strong>, real-life businesses (and even some religious organizations) are using Second Life as a platform for meetings, services and collaboration. <\/p><p>&quot;You can imagine New York City being kind of like a museum,&quot; Rosedale says. &quot;Still an incredibly cool place to go, but with no one working in those towers. You are going to [work] in a virtual world.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"philip_rosedale","published_at":"2008-12-03 01:00:00","updated_at":"2008-12-03 07:53:50"}}
