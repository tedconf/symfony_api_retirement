She&#39;s the principal investigator of the foundation&#39;s Simons Variation in Individuals Project, which characterizes behavior and brain structure and function in participants with genetic copy number variants such as those at 16p11.2, which are believed to play a role in spectrum disorders.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Chung also directs the clinical genetics program at Columbia University. In assessing and treating kids with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, she uses advanced genomic diagnostics to explore the genetic basis of neurological conditions. She thinks deeply about the ethical and emotional questions around genetic medicine and genetic testing.<\/p>","slug":"wendy_chung","published_at":"2014-01-27 15:28:00","updated_at":"2014-04-30 17:56:27"}}
