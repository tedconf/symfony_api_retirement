Billy Graham spoken to millions around the world and served as advisor to US presidents.","whylisten":"<p>According to his official bio, evangelist Billy Graham took the Bible literally where it says in Mark 16:15, &quot;Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.&quot; It&#39;s possible that Graham preached the Gospel to more people in live audiences than anyone else in history -- nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories, with hundreds of millions more through television, video, film and webcasts.<br \/><br \/>Graham wrote some 25 books, and his counsel was sought by many US presidents. He was the first major evangelist to speak behind the Iron Curtain, calling for peace in countries throughout Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union -- while during the Apartheid era he refused to visit South Africa until its government allowed for desegregated audiences. Through the praise and criticism of a public life that has nearly spanned a century, he held fast to his conviction that faith in Jesus is the only path to salvation.<\/p>","slug":"billy_graham","published_at":"2008-07-16 01:00:00","updated_at":"2018-02-21 15:26:13"}}
