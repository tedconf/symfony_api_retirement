","whylisten":"<div>Lucy McRae is an artist who straddles the worlds of fashion, technology and the body. Trained as&nbsp;a classical ballerina and architect, her work &ndash; which is inherently fascinated with the human&nbsp;body &ndash; involves inventing and building structures on the skin that reshape the human&nbsp;silhouette. Her provocative and often grotesquely beautiful imagery suggests a new breed:&nbsp;a future human archetype existing in an alternate world. The media call her an inventor;&nbsp;friends call her a trailblazer. Either way, Lucy relies on instinct to evolve an&nbsp;extraordinary&nbsp;visual path that is powerful, primal and unique.<\/div>","slug":"lucy_mcrae","published_at":"2012-04-06 14:57:00","updated_at":"2012-04-06 15:39:18"}}
