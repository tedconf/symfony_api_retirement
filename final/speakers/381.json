She&#39;s spent most of her career studying caves and karst formations (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Karst\" target=\"_blank\">karst<\/a>  is a formation where a bedrock, such as limestone, is eaten away by water to form underground voids), and is the cofounder of the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.nps.gov\/nckri\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Cave and Karst Research Institute<\/a>, based in New Mexico.<\/p><p>Deep inside caves, there&#39;s a biology that is like no other on Earth, protected from surface stress and dependent on cave conditions for its survival. As part of her work with caves, Boston studies this life -- and has made the very sensible suggestion that, if odd forms of life lie quietly undiscovered in Earth&#39;s caves, there&#39;s a good chance it might also have arisen in caves and karst on other planets.
