She challenges the notion that nature can only be preserved in its pristine, pre-human state, a too-narrow characterization &quot;that thwarts bold new plans to save the environment and prevents us from having a fuller relationship with nature.&quot; Humans have changed the landscape they inhabit since prehistory, and climate change means even the remotest places now bear the fingerprints of humanity. Our influence on the planet means we have new responsibilities for its plants and animals.
