These are plants that can survive extreme drought, &ldquo;resurrecting&rdquo; when moistened or irrigated. If we can better understand their natural preservation mechanisms and their key protectants, she suggests, it could help us develop more drought-tolerant crops to feed populations in increasingly dry and arid climates around the world. Her research may also have medical applications.<\/p> <p class=\"p1\">Farrant was the African\/Arab States recipient of the 2012 L&#39;Oreal-UNESCO Award for Women in Science, one of only five scientists worldwide who were selected by an international jury as &quot;researchers who will have a major impact on society and help light the way to the future.&quot; In 2009, she was awarded an A-rating by the National Research Foundation (the first female researcher at UCT ever to receive such a rating) as well as being made a member of the UCT College of Fellows.<\/p>","slug":"jill_farrant","published_at":"2015-11-17 23:39:00","updated_at":"2016-01-19 16:02:24"}}
