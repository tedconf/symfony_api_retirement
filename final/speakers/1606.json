Bondar, a biologist, hosts the truly astonishing Wild Sex video series on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthtouchnews.com\" target=\"_blank\">earthtouch.tv<\/a> , where over two seasons she&#39;s been using science and uberwatchable storytelling to tell surprising tales of animal mating. As she says: &quot;We hit topics hard, and not just for the quirk factor, but because there is a lot of cool science behind so many strange mating rituals.&quot; <\/p><p>For contrast, her first book, The Nature of Human Nature, examines the unique behaviors of the human species in the context of Darwin&#39;s Survival of the Fittest. Bondar is also the host and producer of SciAm Cinema, a monthly series of the best stories from the Scientific American blog network, and the co-host (with Phil Plait) of TwiST, a weekly series about science and tech on the Science Alert YouTube channel, as well as a TV host for Discovery International and National Geographic Wild.<\/p>","slug":"carin_bondar","published_at":"2013-04-01 02:25:00","updated_at":"2014-03-14 14:44:55"}}
