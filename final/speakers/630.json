Founded in 2005, it grew a user base of tens of thousands and quickly attracted the attention of publisher Cond<em>&eacute;<\/em> Nast, which acquired it in 2006. Unlike &quot;social bookmarking&quot; sites (such as Delicious), Reddit fashions itself a platform for &quot;social news,&quot; where the readers themselves control the front page by voting stories up above and down below the fold.<\/p><p>Ohanian left Reddit in his official capacity in 2009, but returned in 2014 as executive chairman. He has continued to be involved with the site&#39;s direction as a sort of godfather, dispensing friendly wisdom (and t-shirts) from his user account, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/kn0thing\" target=\"_blank\">kn0thing<\/a>. Of late, he&#39;s focusing on Breadpig, a hub for geeky books and merchandise. In early 2010, he spent three months in Armenia as a Kiva Fellow. <\/p>","slug":"alexis_ohanian","published_at":"2009-12-15 14:24:00","updated_at":"2014-11-17 15:00:21"}}
