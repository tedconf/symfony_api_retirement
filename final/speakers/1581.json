In the last few years he has planned and realized pro-bono ad campaigns on behalf of the Ministry of Defense against the guerrilla war in Colombia -- to persuade FARC guerrillas to demoblize.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Realizing that a <em>guerrillero<\/em> is as much a prisoner of his organization as are his hostages, Sokoloff and his team played on the promise of freedom. At Christmas 2010, his agency, Lowe-SSP3 Colombia, placed nine decorated holiday trees in the jungle near a banner ad that read: &quot;If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home. Demobilize.&quot; It won gold at Cannes Lions -- but the most important prize was that it succeeded in its intent, creating a spike in demobilization rates.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>The following year the agency planned a poetic campaign called &quot;Rivers of Light&quot; (Operaci&oacute;n R&iacute;os de Luz), which floated a raft of glowing plastic balls, filled with gifts and messages from family, down rivers that the revolutionaries typically travel. Christmas 2012&#39;s campaign, &quot;Operation Bethlehem,&quot; lit up wayfinding &quot;stars&quot; over local villages, offering defectors a route back.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Meanwhile, Sokoloff&#39;s agency also handles large global consumer clients like Unilever, as well as the Colombian newspaper<em> El Espectador.<\/em>","slug":"jose_miguel_sokoloff","published_at":"2013-03-29 16:03:00","updated_at":"2014-12-08 16:26:26"}}
