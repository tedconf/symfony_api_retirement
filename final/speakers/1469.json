George Will has described his work as &quot;exemplary journalistic sleuthing.&quot; His most recent book is&nbsp;<em>The Family Roe: An American Story<\/em>, which&nbsp;delves into the Supreme Court&rsquo;s most divisive case, <em>Roe v. Wade<\/em>, and the unknown lives at its heart.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Prager&#39;s book&nbsp;<em>100 Years<\/em>&nbsp;is a list of literary quotations on every age from birth to one hundred. Designed by Milton Glaser, the legendary graphic designer who created the I &hearts; NY logo, the book moves year by year through the words of our most beloved authors, revealing the great sequence of life. His first book, <em>The Echoing Green<\/em>, was a <em>Washington Post<\/em> Best Book of the Year. <em>The New York Times Book Review<\/em> called it &quot;a revelation and a page turner, a group character study unequaled in baseball writing since Roger Kahn&rsquo;s Boys of Summer some three decades ago.&quot; His second book, <em>Half-Life<\/em>, describes his recovery from a bus crash that broke his neck. Dr. Jerome Groopman, staff writer at the New Yorker magazine, called it &quot;an extraordinary memoir, told with nuance and brimming with wisdom.&quot;<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Prager was a Nieman fellow at Harvard in 2011 and a Fulbright Distinguished Chair at Hebrew University in 2012. He was born in Eagle Butte, South Dakota, grew up in New Jersey, and lives in New York.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"joshua_prager","published_at":"2013-01-06 13:44:00","updated_at":"2022-05-27 14:31:31"}}
