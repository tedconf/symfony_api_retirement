Paleontologist Michael Archer says: They don&#39;t! He&#39;s working to de-extinct the gastric brooding frog and the thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger. These animals could have taught us humans a lot, says Archer, but we wiped them out. A severe missed opportunity.<\/p><p>Archer is a professor in the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. Archer&#39;s research includes: conservation through sustainable use of native resources -- including having native animals as pets -- and trying to bring extinct species back into the world of the living. Previously Archer served as the Curator of Mammals at the Queensland Museum and Director of the Australian Museum in Sydney.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"michael_archer","published_at":"2013-06-27 14:27:00","updated_at":"2013-06-27 14:54:56"}}
