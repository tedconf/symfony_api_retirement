Anti, whose given name is Zhao Jing, ran up against Facebook&#39;s real-name policy--but he points out that for Chinese bloggers and information activists, the pseudonym is an important protection for the free exchange of information.<\/p>  <p>Facebook itself is blocked in China (along with Twitter and YouTube), but the country boasts some 500 million netizens--including 200 million microbloggers on sites like Sina Weibo, a freewheeling though monitored platform for text and photo updates that offers, perhaps for the first time, a space for public debate in China. It&#39;s not a western-style space, Anti clarifies, but for China it is revolutionary: It&#39;s the first national public sphere. Microblogs&#39; role became clear in the wake of the high-speed train crash in Wenzhou in 2011, when Weibo became a locus of activism and complaint--and a backchannel that refuted official reports and has continued to play a key role in more recent events.<\/p>","slug":"michael_anti","published_at":"2012-05-01 21:03:00","updated_at":"2012-09-10 19:05:11"}}
