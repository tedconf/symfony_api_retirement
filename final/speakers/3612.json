Founding and running <a href=\"http:\/\/holaafrica.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">HOLAAfrica<\/a>  helped to bring together her various skills as it demanded all of them, all the time. <\/p><p>A passion for making sure people had the orgasms and conversations that elude them whilst being given the comprehensive healthy knowledge of sexuality that eluded her meant that HOLAAfrica forced her to grow as a blogger, project creator and guru of excel spreadsheets. The need to have conversations about sex and sexuality, seeing what the novel ways this could be done whilst exploring what boundaries could be pushed meant that her life at the helm of HOLAAfrica and her personal consultancy work grew, and life got wild. Sometimes the best life choices come from trying to figure out how to get through your own existence. <\/p>","slug":"tiffany_kagure_mugo","published_at":"2017-09-10 21:30:00","updated_at":"2018-02-23 16:20:36"}}
