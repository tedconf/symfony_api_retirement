His research is helping build tomorrow's robots, based on evolution's ancient engineering.","whylisten":"<p>UC Berkeley biologist Robert Full is fascinated by the&nbsp;motion of creatures like cockroaches, crabs and geckos having many legs,&nbsp;unusual feet or&nbsp;talented tails. He has led an effort to demonstrate the value&nbsp;of learning from Nature by the creating interdisciplinary collaborations of&nbsp;biologists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists from academia and&nbsp;industry. He founded <a href=\"http:\/\/ciber.berkeley.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">CiBER<\/a>, the Center for interdisciplinary&nbsp;Bio-inspiration in&nbsp;Education and Research, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/polypedal.berkeley.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Poly-PEDAL Laboratory<\/a>, which studies the&nbsp;Performance, Energetics and Dynamics of&nbsp;Animal Locomotion (PEDAL) in&nbsp;many-footed creatures (Poly). <\/p><p>His research shows how studying a diversity of&nbsp;animals leads to the discovery of&nbsp;general principles which inspire the design&nbsp;of novel circuits, artificial muscles, exoskeletons, versatile scampering legged search-and-rescue&nbsp;robots and&nbsp;synthetic self-cleaning dry adhesives based on gecko feet. He is&nbsp;passionate about discovery-based education leading to innovation -- and he&nbsp;even&nbsp;helped Pixar&rsquo;s insect animations in the film&nbsp;<em>A Bug&#39;s Life.<\/em><\/p>","slug":"robert_full","published_at":"2007-11-27 01:31:00","updated_at":"2016-07-13 15:40:49"}}
