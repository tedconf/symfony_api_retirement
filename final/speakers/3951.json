It instilled in him a deep love of science and the scientific endeavor, which in turn led him to complete a PhD in theoretical particle physics. Isaac Asimov&#39;s story &quot;The Fun They Had,&quot; about computerized homeschooling, prompted him to consider how digital technology might deepen students&#39; learning, which in turn led to posts in a variety of UK universities.<\/p><p>And it was in the pages of a science fiction magazine that he first encountered the Fermi paradox, which kindled a lifelong fascination with the problem of why we see no signs of extraterrestrial intelligence -- and led to his book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/gb\/book\/9783319132358\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Where Is Everybody<\/em><\/a>, which explores the question in detail. Webb hopes to pass on his love of science through his outreach work, and he is the author of a number of popular science books. He is working on <em>New Light Through Old Windows<\/em>, an anthology of classic science fiction tales; each tale appears alongside a commentary detailing the latest scientific thinking relating to the story&#39;s theme.<\/p>","slug":"stephen_webb","published_at":"2018-02-11 16:11:00","updated_at":"2018-07-19 14:47:01"}}
