As a close-up magician, he&#39;s won international awards for his elegantly thought-through performances, which merge a nuanced stagecraft with good old how-does-he-do-it sleight of hand. He is the world&#39;s youngest-ever World Champion of Card Magic. He reflects on his craft in the enigmatic out-of-print book,&nbsp;<em>Reflections<\/em>.<br \/><br \/>His appearances at LA&#39;s Magic Castle led him to be awarded the title of Parlour Magician of The Year, in 2011 and 2012, recognition that drew hours-long queues as audiences (and fellow magicians) flocked to the simple and astonishing act. Also, in 2012, he co-created a show called <em>Nothing to Hide<\/em>, with Derek DelGaudio, which opened at the Geffen Playhouse, directed by magic superfan Neil Patrick Harris. In 2013, the show was taken to Off-Broadway where it stayed for a very successful held-over run of 110 performances.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"helder_guimaraes","published_at":"2014-01-24 08:34:00","updated_at":"2015-02-27 14:17:18"}}
