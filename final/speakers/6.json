As chief of design for the BMW Group, Chris Bangle has overseen cars that have been seen the world over, including BMW 7 Series and the Z4 roadster.","whylisten":"<p>American designer Chris Bangle understands that <strong>it can be difficult to see a car in terms of Art with a capital A<\/strong>. As such, he separates his work into issues of &quot;automobiles&quot; (unemotional products, causing problems such as pollution and congestion) and &quot;car-iness&quot; (an expansion of the human, and ultimately a truly artistic expression). Satisfying the tensions between these problems -- and the tensions between engineers and designers -- is, for him, the essence of his work. <\/p><p>Offering <strong>radical forms and ideas<\/strong>, Bangle has been a polarizing figure within the industry; he has overseen all of the brands within the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bmw.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BMW<\/a>  family, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mini.com\/mini_worldwide\/mini_worldwide.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mini<\/a>  and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rolls-Royce<\/a>. In 2009, Bangle left BMW to pursue his own personal design interests and develop his consulting firm, Chris Bangle Associates.<\/p>","slug":"chris_bangle","published_at":"2007-02-13 10:59:00","updated_at":"2017-04-06 18:42:45"}}
