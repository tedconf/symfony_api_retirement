Physics, in particular particle physics, quenched her desire for knowledge. Our incomplete understanding of the universe motivates her to search for evidence of new particles and how they interact.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Malone believes that we need to make science as accessible and diverse as possible. She believes being able to benefit from many different insights&nbsp;is possibly the best route to find solutions to the biggest problems that we face today. Her thoughts have also been influenced through conducting her research with her own physical disabilities. She is passionate about communicating her enthusiasm for physics to a wide audience and advocating for the inclusion of groups that are typically under-represented in STEM subjects.<\/p><p>In her spare time, she also enjoys reading (and sometimes writing) sci-fi novels.<\/p>","slug":"claire_malone","published_at":"2021-07-13 22:56:00","updated_at":"2021-07-16 18:09:50"}}
