Craig Venter Institute: to build a synthetic cell from scratch. Within days, he was on a path to creating synthetic life alongside genomics pioneers. But to build a whole genome from scratch, Gibson had to first invent new methods to assemble DNA. One method, dubbed the &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/v6\/n5\/abs\/nmeth.1318.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gibson Assembly<\/a>,&quot; became a game changer, and a series of firsts followed: first synthetic bacterial genome, first synthetic cell, first minimal cell. Today, these discoveries inform the design of synthetic DNA used for new medicines.<\/p><p>Gibson&#39;s teams at SGI and SGI-DNA recently introduced the world&#39;s first biologic teleporter, called the Digital-to-Biological Converter (DBC), which turns digital code into functional biologics in the form of DNA, RNA&nbsp;and proteins without human intervention. Imagine a future where digital code is emailed to DBCs at hospitals around the world to deliver personalized medicine at a patient&#39;s bedside.<\/p>","slug":"dan_gibson","published_at":"2018-02-10 20:59:00","updated_at":"2018-07-11 14:48:42"}}
