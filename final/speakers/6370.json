Her favorite molecular biosignature is phosphine: a terrifying gas associated with mostly unpleasant life. When she isn&#39;t deciphering exoplanet atmospheres, she works to persuade the next generation of scientists to become an active part of the astronomical community.<\/p><p>Sousa-Silva holds a doctoral degree in quantum chemistry from the University College London and a master&#39;s degree in physics and astronomy from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Among her achievements, she is the recipient of the prestigious 51 Pegasi b Fellowship from the Heising-Simons Foundation. The fellowship supports exceptional postdoctoral scientists who make unique contributions to the growing field of planetary astronomy. Her work and commentary has been featured in the BBC, <em>Forbes<\/em>, <em>WIRED<\/em>&nbsp;and the <em>New York Times<\/em>, among others. Prior to joining the Center for Astrophysics, she served as a research scientist at MIT.<\/p>","slug":"clara_sousa_silva","published_at":"2021-05-18 17:20:00","updated_at":"2021-07-21 16:22:15"}}
