She&#39;s now an instructional designer, author and educator, working on how to change and innovate within schools to make education work better for more kids. She teaches at Penn State University in the College of Education, working primarily with  doctoral-level students to help produce the next  generation of faculty with inspired research ideas and  methods.&nbsp;Carr-Chellman also teaches online courses focused on helping  practicing teachers learn how to improve their own instructional design  practices and how to improve their classrooms.<br \/><br \/>Her recent research projects include &quot;Bring Back the Boys,&quot; looking at ways gaming can be used to re-engage boys in their elementary  education. Another projects asks prisoners  and homeless people to think about how to reform schools, bringing new  voices to the policy-making table.\u2028\u2028\u2028\u2028\u2028<\/p>","slug":"ali_carr_chellman","published_at":"2011-01-14 15:43:00","updated_at":"2011-01-19 14:12:18"}}
