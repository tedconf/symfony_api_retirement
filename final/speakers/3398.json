The algorithm looks like the simple face detection of a camera app but with the level complexity of systems like Google&#39;s Deep Mind Cloud Vision, using Convolutional Deep Neural Networks to crunch object detection in realtime. It&#39;s the kind of technology that will be embedded on all smartphones in the next few years.<\/p>  <p>Redmon is also internet-famous for <a href=\"https:\/\/pjreddie.com\/static\/Redmon%20Resume.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">his resume<\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"joseph_redmon","published_at":"2017-03-18 22:40:00","updated_at":"2017-08-04 15:02:54"}}
