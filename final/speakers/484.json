From the highest and coldest mountaintop of Hawaii, home of the Keck Observatory telescopes, <strong>using bleeding-edge deep-space-scrying technology<\/strong>, Ghez handily confirmed 30 years of suspicions of what lies at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy -- a supermassive black hole, which sends its satellite stars spinning in orbits approaching the speed of light. <br \/><br \/>Ghez received a MacArthur &quot;genius grant&quot; in 2008 for her work in surmounting the limitations of earthbound telescopes. Early in her career,<strong> she developed a technique known as speckle imaging<\/strong>, which combined many short exposures from a telescope into one much-crisper image. Lately she&#39;s been using adaptive optics to further sharpen our view from here -- and compile evidence of young stars at the center of the universe.<\/p> ","slug":"andrea_ghez","published_at":"2009-06-23 11:08:00","updated_at":"2009-12-02 09:20:25"}}
