What kind of game will be played on this immersive new equipment? Peter Molyneux is working on one that <strong>redefines the whole notion of &quot;game&quot;<\/strong> -- Milo. <\/p><p>Milo is a little boy (there&#39;s also to be a little girl, Kate) who quite simply acts like a little boy, learning your name, talking with you, going on walks around the lake. It&#39;s an immersive, slightly uncanny experience, as seen in the single year-old demo that&#39;s still blowing minds on YouTube. Molyneux himself is <strong>a game-industry legend<\/strong> who has created many titles. In 1997 he founded Lionhead Studios, makers of Fable, a role-playing game. Microsoft bought Lionhead in 2006, and will release the much-anticipated Fable III in the fall.<\/p>","slug":"peter_molyneux","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2010-08-18 08:48:16"}}
