She speaks out against victim-blaming and slut-shaming attitudes that often surround this pervasive and insidious problem.<\/p> <p class=\"p1\">Martin was involved in the law reform efforts across Australia, in New South Wales, Western Australia and at the Commonwealth level, to criminalise image-based sexual abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p class=\"p2\">Since her TEDxPerth talk, Martin has completed her law degree in Australia and is working towards being admitted as a lawyer. She hopes to use her law degree to fight for justice for victims and survivors of image-based abuse and deepfakes.&nbsp;Her goal is to hold perpetrators and tech companies who fail to take adequate action to combat this abuse to account.<\/p>","slug":"noelle_martin","published_at":"2019-06-03 21:58:00","updated_at":"2020-02-13 16:11:46"}}
