To create these microscopic masterpieces, he works diligently through the stillest hours of the night, between his own heartbeats.","whylisten":"<p>Willard Wigan has immortalized the Obama family in the eye of a needle and Muhammad Ali on the head of a match. In producing sculptures so incredibly small, he works under a microscope and employs ingenious tools, such as a fly&#39;s hair or an ex-girlfriend&#39;s eyelash for paintbrushes. <br \/><br \/>This passion for the diminutive stems from feelings of insignificance in Wigan&#39;s childhood. He was severely dyslexic but undiagnosed, and his teachers&#39; harsh words drove him to hide in a nearby shed where he made shoes and hats for his friends, the ants. Today, his art has earned him national honors and critical acclaim, proving that some treasures can&#39;t be seen with the naked eye.<\/p>","slug":"willard_wigan","published_at":"2009-06-23 11:20:00","updated_at":"2017-06-08 16:16:24"}}
