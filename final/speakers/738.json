In live works that integrate animation, performance, and video installation, she explores how animation changes when it is combined with body and space (and vice versa). In her video projects, animation takes on a more physical and present quality, while body and space take on a more fantastical quality. <\/p><p>On one hand, Matreyek&#39;s performance can be viewed as a cinematic experience taking place on a screen. On the other hand, what is seen on the screen is a collapsed product of multiple layers of animation, objects and body. Her work exists in a juxtaposition of illusion and nonillusion. Matreyek is also a founding member of the performance media group Cloud Eye Control, which makes theatrical productions with cleverly integrated animation projections.<\/p><p>The piece Matreyek performs at TEDGlobal 2010 is an abridgement of the work &quot;Myth and Infrastructure.&quot; <\/p><p><strong>Music credits:<\/strong><\/p><p>Shadow Hands scene song: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.annaoxygen.com\/Anna_Oxygen\/now.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Oxygen<\/a> <br \/>Island scene song: &quot;Shells&quot; by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/cmonmirah\" target=\"_blank\">Mirah<\/a>, (a)spera, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.krecs.com\/Shop\/product_info.php?cPath=21_31&amp;products_id=4328\" target=\"_blank\">K records<\/a> <br \/>City scene song: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carolinelufkin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Caroline Lufkin<\/a> <br \/>Magic Hands scene song: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.annaoxygen.com\/Anna_Oxygen\/now.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anna Oxygen<\/a> <br \/>additional music by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/mileece\" target=\"_blank\">Mileece<\/a>  <\/p>","slug":"miwa_matreyek","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2010-10-29 13:29:31"}}
