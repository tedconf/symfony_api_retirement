By night, she helps others maintain their quality of life as they near death.","whylisten":"<p>Judy MacDonald Johnston is the Publisher and Cofounder of <a href=\"http:\/\/bluelakepublishing.com\/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Lake Children&#39;s Publishing<\/a>, which develops educational reading tools for preschoolers through a program called the Tessy and Tab Reading Club. Johnston&#39;s credo, &quot;love words early,&quot; and her focus on the earliest years of life, is an interesting foil for her other passion: Planning for end of life. Johnston&#39;s side project, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodendoflife.com\/about.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Good [End of] Life<\/a>, deals not with happy babies decoding symbols, but with a much more morbid topic: Death. Good [End of] Life is a set of online worksheets and practices that aim to help deal with difficult questions -- like who should speak for you if you cannot speak, and whether to fill out a do-not-resuscitate form -- before it&#39;s too late.<\/p><p>In the past 15 years alone Johnston has founded two other companies in addition to Blue Lake Children&#39;s Publishing: PrintPaks, a children&#39;s software company, and Kibu, a social networking site for teenage girls. Previously Johnston was a Worldwide Project Marketing Manager at Hewlett Packard.<\/p>","slug":"judy_macdonald_johnston","published_at":"2013-05-21 18:24:00","updated_at":"2013-05-23 17:06:08"}}
