He jumpstarted the Dubai standup comedy scene and produced the Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour.","whylisten":"<p>After fifteen years working in UK television, Jamil Abu-Wardeh moved to Dubai with a big idea: to bring modern standup comedy to the Middle East. His grassroots efforts to build a standup scene in Dubai, and then across the region, led to the first standup comedy time slot in the programming of Showtime Arabia. And this led to a ground- and record-breaking tour of five Arab countries: The Axis of Evil Middle East Comedy Tour. Lines around the block, performances for royalty -- the tour tapped into a shared desire to laugh. <\/p><p>Standup comedians on the tour avoid the three B&#39;s (blue material, beliefs and &quot;bolitics&quot;) but are free to poke fun everywhere else. One of Abu-Wardeh&#39;s stars, proteg&eacute; Wonho Chung, is a Korean kid who speaks perfect Arabic and is wildly popular on YouTube in Saudi Arabia -- proving to Abu-Wardeh that lines between national groups can be broken down if you&#39;re just funny enough. The impresario is constantly creating content and chances for aspiring comics, and his work has helped touch off a new flowering of standup comedy in the region.<\/p>","slug":"jamil_abu_wardeh","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2010-08-19 08:57:21"}}
