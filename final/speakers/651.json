The pursuit led to other spectacles featuring cramped spaces and extreme conditions: <em>Frozen in Time<\/em>, which saw him encased in a block of ice for almost three days, and <em>Vertigo<\/em>, where he stood atop a 100-foot pillar for 35 hours.<br \/><br \/>Blaine&#39;s stunts continue to draw immense crowds and Nielsen ratings to match, but his appearance on <em>Oprah<\/em> was perhaps most stunning, when he broke the Guinness world record for breath-holding, staying underwater for 17 minutes and 4.5 seconds.<\/p>","slug":"david_blaine","published_at":"2010-01-19 08:15:00","updated_at":"2014-08-12 14:47:01"}}
