He was born in 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as Jorge Mario Bergoglio, in a family of Italian immigrants. A Jesuit, he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires and then a Cardinal leading the Argentinian church. Upon election as the 266th Pope, he chose Francis as his papal name in reference to Saint Francis of Assisi.<\/p><p>A very popular figure who has taken it upon himself to reform the Catholic Church, Pope Francis&#39;s worldview is solidly anchored in humility, simplicity, mercy, social justice, attention to the poor and the dispossessed -- those he says &quot;our culture disposes of like waste&quot; -- and in a critical attitude towards unbridled capitalism and consumerism. He is a strong advocate of global action against climate change, to which he has devoted his powerful 2015 encyclical,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/w2.vatican.va\/content\/francesco\/en\/encyclicals\/documents\/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Laudato Si&#39;<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;(&quot;Praise be to you&quot;). He invites us to practice &quot;tenderness,&quot; putting ourselves &quot;at the level of the other,&quot; to listen and care. He is committed to interfaith dialogue and is seen as a moral and spiritual authority across the world by many people who aren&#39;t Catholics.<\/p>","slug":"pope_francis","published_at":"2017-04-18 20:09:00","updated_at":"2020-10-06 14:05:46"}}
