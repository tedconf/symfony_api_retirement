These attempts are made to raise questions on ownership of sound,<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> explore oral languages as social currency, deconstruct preconceived ideas about silence, and above all, unlearn sound etiquette.<\/span><\/p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">As part of her practice, Kim borrows other people&rsquo;s voices in order to have one and she does it by collaborating with artists such as Devont&eacute; Hynes, Thomas Benno Mader, Wolfgang M&uuml;ller and Alison O&rsquo;Daniel. Selected exhibitions and performances include: Sound Live Tokyo, Tokyo; White Space, Beijing; LEAP, Berlin; Carroll \/ Fletcher, London; nyMusikk, Oslo; Andquestionmark, Stockholm; Southern Exposure, San Francisco; Recess Activities, New York; Calder Foundation, New York; and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Additionally, she was a recipient of Artist Residency at Whitney Museum, Haverford College, Southern Exposure, Arnolfini, University of Texas&rsquo; Visual Arts Center and Fellowship at TED and MIT Media Lab.<\/span><\/p>","slug":"christine_sun_kim","published_at":"2015-08-18 08:08:00","updated_at":"2015-10-28 15:45:54"}}
