His 1997 <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/darwinamongmachines\"><em>Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence<\/em><\/a> (&ldquo;the last book about the Internet written without the Internet&rdquo;) explored the history and prehistory of digital computing and telecommunications as a manifestation of the convergent destiny of organisms and machines.  <\/p><p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/projectorion\">Project Orion: The True Story of the Atomic Spaceship<\/a>,<\/em> published in 2002, assembled first-person interviews and recently declassified documents to tell the story of a path not taken into space: a nuclear-powered spaceship whose objective was to land a party of 100 people on Mars four years before we landed two people on the Moon. <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/turingscathedral\"><em>Turing&#39;s Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe<\/em><\/a>, published in 2012, illuminated the transition from numbers that mean things to numbers that do things in the aftermath of World War II.  <\/p><p>Dyson&rsquo;s current project, <em>Analogia<\/em>, is a semi-autobiographical reflection on how analog computation is re-establishing control over the digital world.<\/p>","slug":"george_dyson","published_at":"2008-02-14 05:12:00","updated_at":"2015-07-10 20:19:29"}}
