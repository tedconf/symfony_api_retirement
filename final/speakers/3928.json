From social networks to interactive TV, virtual reality to immersive theatre, interactive storytelling is the next frontier for a new generation of writers.<\/p><p>Many people have preconceived ideas about video games, and sometimes they are right. But few people know that games can also be a wonderful creative medium capable of telling a new kind of narrative. In most art forms, the audience is watching passively. With interactive storytelling, the spectator becomes the hero of his own story.<\/p><p>David Cage dedicated his career to trying to understand how to tell interactive stories. Convinced that games can be more than entertainment, he tries to show that they can be a new form of expression, maybe even a new form of art, capable of emulating the interactive nature of life itself.<\/p>","slug":"david_cage","published_at":"2018-02-10 21:18:00","updated_at":"2018-11-20 20:41:25"}}
