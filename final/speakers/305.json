He created the Deep Flight series of winged submersibles, which \"fly\" to the depths of the oceans with the power and elegance of an airplane.","whylisten":"<p>Graham Hawkes has created a new generation of high-tech undersea vessels that truly augment the way terrestrials experience the immense, otherworldly habitats of the oceans. His Deep Flight submersibles <strong>look like airplanes and behave like ocean creatures, using their wings and unique propulsion to gracefully soar and somersault into the deep<\/strong> -- giving their pilot an unprecedented 3D perspective. According to his website, Hawkes&#39; designs account for a &quot;significant percentage of manned and unmanned vehicles used by science and industry.&quot;<\/p><p>Hawkes leads <a href=\"http:\/\/www.deepflight.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hawkes Ocean Technologies<\/a>, whose submersibles were featured in James Cameron&#39;s 3D IMAX film, <em>Aliens of the Deep<\/em>. His company also produced the WASP and Mantis Atmospheric Diving Suits, built to facilitate undersea pipelaying. Hawkes currently holds the world record for the deepest solo dive -- 3,000 feet -- using one of his own inventions, the Deep Rover submersible. <\/p>","slug":"graham_hawkes","published_at":"2008-11-02 11:38:00","updated_at":"2008-11-03 08:01:24"}}
