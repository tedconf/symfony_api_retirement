Since studying at Harvard and Oxford in the 1960s, he&#39;s written dozens of books, and initiated ambitious projects -- cofounding the influential, environment-focused <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rmi.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Mountain Institute<\/a>; prototyping the ultra-efficient Hypercar -- to <strong>focus the world&#39;s attention on alternative approaches to energy<\/strong> and transportation. <\/p><p>His critical thinking has driven people around the globe -- from world leaders to the average Joe -- to <strong>think differently about energy and its role in some of our biggest problems<\/strong>: climate change, oil dependency, national security, economic health, and depletion of natural resources. <\/p><p>Lovins offers solutions as well. His new book and site, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rmi.org\/ReinventingFire\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reinventing Fire<\/em><\/a>, offers actionable solutions for four energy-intensive sectors of the  economy: transportation, buildings, industry and electricity. Lovins has always focused on solutions that conserve natural resources while also promoting economic growth; Texas Instruments and Wal-Mart are just two of the mega-corporations he has advised on improving energy efficiency. <\/p>","slug":"amory_lovins","published_at":"2007-02-14 11:14:00","updated_at":"2012-05-23 17:00:05"}}
