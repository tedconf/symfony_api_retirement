","whylisten":"<p>The former CEO of Gehl Foods, a high-tech food manufacturing company in Wisconsin, Katherine Gehl sold the company to focus on political innovation because, as she often says: &ldquo;Life is short, and you have to play games worth losing.&rdquo; Translation: She wanted to work on harder and more important project -- which makes trying to fix politics a perfect fit.<\/p><p>In 2013, while leading a classic corporate strategy project at Gehl Foods, Gehl had an epiphany: why doesn&rsquo;t competition in politics deliver innovation, results and accountability -- the best of what free market competition delivers in other industries? Her analysis and strategy for political change have come to be called Politics Industry and Final-Five Voting respectively.<\/p><p>In 2020, she co-authored <em>The Politics Industry: How Political Innovation Can Break Partisan Gridlock and Save Our Democracy<\/em>, with Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School and founded the non-profit Institute for Political Innovation (IPI). IPI&rsquo;s goal is less talk, more action by supporting leaders and teams to pass Final Five Voting legislation across the country. In November 2020, Final-Five Voting had its first win in Alaska, and Katherine has promised more wins to come to her three-year-old son, Teddy (named after political innovator President Theodore Roosevelt), and 15 year old daughter, Alexandra.<\/p><p>Gehl calls herself politically homeless and estimates that she&rsquo;s said, &ldquo;Final Five Voting is not a trojan horse for either party&rsquo;s partisan advantage,&rdquo; about 5000 times.<\/p>","slug":"katherine_gehl","published_at":"2021-04-05 21:45:00","updated_at":"2021-04-05 21:47:47"}}
