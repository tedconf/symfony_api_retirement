She is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and has given multiple performances at the White House at the invitation of President and First Lady Obama. Jones is now at work on a new solo show called <em>Sell\/Buy\/Date,&nbsp;<\/em>commissioned by the Novo Foundation. She debuted material from it at TED2015. She is also working on a commission for Lincoln Center Theater and a television project based on her characters.<\/p> ","slug":"sarah_jones","published_at":"2009-04-29 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-06-09 13:09:19"}}
