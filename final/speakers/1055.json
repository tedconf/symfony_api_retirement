Many, from Leonardo da Vinci to contemporary research teams, tried to crack the &quot;code&quot; for the flight of birds, unsuccessfully. Until in 2011 the engineers of the Bionic Learning Network established by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.festo.com\/net\/startpage\/\" target=\"_blank\">Festo<\/a>, a German technology company, developed a flight model of an artificial bird that&#39;s capable of taking off and rising in the air by means of its flapping wings alone. It&#39;s called SmartBird. Markus Fischer is Festo&#39;s head of corporate design, where he&#39;s responsible for a wide array of initiatives. He established the Bionic Learning Network in 2006.<br \/><br \/>SmartBird is inspired by the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/European_Herring_Gull\" target=\"_blank\">herring gull<\/a>. The wings not only beat up and down but twist like those of a real bird -- and seeing it fly leaves no doubt: it&#39;s a perfect technical imitation of the natural model, just bigger. (Even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.contagiousmagazine.com\/2011\/07\/ted_global.php\" target=\"_blank\">birds think so<\/a>.) Its wingspan is almost two meters, while its carbon-fiber structure weighs only 450 grams.<\/p><p>Fischer says: &quot;We learned from the birds how to move the wings, but also the need to be very energy efficient.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"markus_fischer","published_at":"2011-05-26 16:17:00","updated_at":"2011-07-22 14:26:32"}}
