And this is what I tried to accomplish in all these years of work: making buildings (one of the heaviest things you can make) that float above grounds. I also like to create buildings that could be shelter for human beings: good places for people to meet and share experiences. This is also the way cities become more beautiful cities, and this is why it is so important to me. In my job you need to be different things at a time: a builder in the morning, a poet at lunchtime and a humanist in the afternoon. It is one of the oldest and most adventurous things you can do. I can&#39;t think of a better way to spend my time every day.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"renzo_piano","published_at":"2018-02-11 15:43:00","updated_at":"2018-07-13 14:12:58"}}
