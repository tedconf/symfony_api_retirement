","whylisten":"<p>In Nigeria, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&#39;s novel&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/halfofayellowsun\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Half of a Yellow Sun<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;has helped inspire new, cross-generational communication about the Biafran war. In this and in her other works, she seeks to instill dignity into the finest details of each character, whether poor, middle class or rich, exposing along the way the deep scars of colonialism in the African landscape. <br \/><br \/>Adichie&#39;s newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/thingaroundyourneck\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Thing Around Your Neck<\/em><\/a>, is a brilliant collection of stories about Nigerians struggling to cope with a corrupted context in their home country, and about the Nigerian immigrant experience. <br \/><br \/>Adichie builds on the literary tradition of Igbo literary giant Chinua Achebe&mdash;and when she found out that Achebe liked <em>Half of a Yellow Sun<\/em>, she says she cried for a whole day. What he said about her rings true: &ldquo;We do not usually associate wisdom with beginners, but here is a new writer endowed with the gift of ancient storytellers.&rdquo;<\/p><p>(Photo: Wani Olatunde)&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"chimamanda_ngozi_adichie","published_at":"2009-06-19 14:59:00","updated_at":"2017-04-07 20:17:20"}}
