These fluctuations have led scientists to postulate causes ranging from comet dust (Boyajian&#39;s most likely scenario) to alien megastructures. The latest studies of Tabby&#39;s star have proved even more baffling: KIC 8462852 has been gradually dimming over the last century, a strikingly short period of time on an astronomical scale.<br \/><br \/>Boyajian currently serves as a postdoc with the Yale Exoplanet group, whose research is assisted by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.planethunters.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Planet Hunters<\/a>&nbsp;-- a citizen science group that combs data from the NASA Kepler Space Mission for evidence of exoplanets and other unusual interstellar activity.","slug":"tabetha_boyajian","published_at":"2016-01-28 19:00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-07 14:37:17"}}
