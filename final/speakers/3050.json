IKAR&rsquo;s goal is to reinvigorate Jewish religious and spiritual practice, inspiring people of faith to reclaim a moral and prophetic voice in counter-testimony to the small-minded extremism now prevalent in so many religious communities. IKAR quickly became one of the fastest growing and most influential Jewish congregations in the country, and it&#39;s widely credited with sparking a rethinking of religious life in a time of unprecedented disaffection and declining affiliation.<\/p><p>In 2008, Brous was the youngest person on the <em>Newsweek\/Daily Beast<\/em> list of the most influential Rabbis in America, and in 2013 she was named the list&rsquo;s most influential rabbi. In 2013, Brous blessed President Obama and Vice President Biden at the Inaugural National Prayer Service.<\/p>","slug":"sharon_brous","published_at":"2016-09-07 20:33:00","updated_at":"2016-12-21 16:02:38"}}
