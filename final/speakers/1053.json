As a director, his work is rooted in observing life as it presents itself in all its complexities -- as shown in his latest documentary, <em>An African Election<\/em>, which follows the 2008 presidential elections in Ghana, West Africa. <\/p><p>Merz&#39;s stepfather, a political player on Ghana, helped him get access behind the scenes; then Jarreth and his cameraman brother Kevin followed the presidential candidates in the unpredictable months leading up to the final night. In chronicling the rough-and-tumble process of a democratic election, the documentary becomes a meditation on the dream of democracy itself. The film screened in the World Documentary competition at Sundance earlier this year. Merz is now working on a &ldquo;political safari&rdquo; in Africa.<\/p><p>He says: &quot;<em>An African Election<\/em> challenges the preconceived notion we have about politics in Ghana or Africa without hiding the brutal realities.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"jarreth_merz","published_at":"2011-05-26 16:11:00","updated_at":"2012-08-10 17:16:56"}}
