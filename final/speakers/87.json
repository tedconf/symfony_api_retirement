In 2013, he set out on another record-breaking expedition, this time to retrace Captain Scott\u2019s ill-fated journey to the South Pole on foot.","whylisten":"<p>Although most of the planet&#39;s surface was mapped long ago, there&#39;s still a place for explorers in the modern world. And Ben Saunders&#39; stories of arctic exploration -- as impressive for their technical ingenuity as their derring-do -- are decidedly modern. In 2004, at age 26, he skied solo to the North Pole, updating his blog  each day of the trip. Humble and self-effacing, Saunders is an explorer of limits, whether it&#39;s how far a human can be pushed physically and psychologically, or how technology works hundreds of miles from civilization.   His message is one of inspiration, empowerment and boundless potential. <br \/><br \/>He urges audiences to consider carefully how to spend the &ldquo;tiny amount of time we each have on this planet.&rdquo; Saunders is also a powerful advocate for the natural world. He&#39;s seen first-hand the effects of climate change, and his expeditions are raising awareness for sustainable solutions.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Being the youngest person to ski solo to the North Pole did not satiate Saunders&#39; urge to explore and push the boundaries. In 2008, he attempted to break the speed record for a solo walk to the North Pole; however, his journey was ended abruptly both then and again in 2010 due to equipment failure. From October 2013 to February 2014, he led a two-man team to retrace Captain Robert Falcon Scott&rsquo;s ill-fated 1,800-mile expedition to the South Pole on foot. He calls this journey the hardest 105 days of his life.<\/p>","slug":"ben_saunders","published_at":"2007-03-14 22:35:00","updated_at":"2017-09-28 22:30:07"}}
