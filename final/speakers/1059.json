His latest work examines the parallels between linguistic and biological evolution by applying methods of phylogenetics, or the study of evolutionary relatedness among groups, essentially viewing language as a culturally transmitted replicator with many of the same properties we find in genes. He&rsquo;s looking for patterns in the rates of evolution of language elements, and hoping to find the social factors that influence trends of language evolution.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>At the University of Reading, Pagel heads the Evolution Laboratory in the biology department, where he explores such questions as, &quot;Why would humans evolve a system of communication that prevents them with communicating with other members of the same species?&quot; He has used statistical methods to reconstruct features of dinosaur genomes, and to infer ancestral features of genes and proteins. <\/p><p>He says: &quot;Just as we have highly conserved genes, we have highly conserved words. Language shows a truly remarkable fidelity.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"mark_pagel","published_at":"2011-05-31 13:03:00","updated_at":"2011-08-03 15:08:51"}}
