Marla Spivak, University of Minnesota professor of entomology and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macfound.org\/fellows\/43\/\" target=\"_blank\">2010 MacArthur Fellow<\/a>, tries as much as possible to think like bees in her work to protect them. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;highly social and complex&rdquo; creatures, she says, which fuels her interest and her research.<\/p> <p>Spivak has developed a strain of bees, the Minnesota Hygienic line, that can detect when pupae are infected and kick them out of the nest, saving the rest of the hive. Now, Spivak is studying how bees collect propolis, or tree resins, in their hives to keep out dirt and microbes. She is also analyzing how flowers&rsquo; decline due to herbicides, pesticides and crop monoculture affect bees&rsquo; numbers and diversity. Spivak has been stung by thousands of bees in the course of her work.<\/p>","slug":"marla_spivak","published_at":"2013-03-29 18:27:00","updated_at":"2013-09-17 13:35:07"}}
