These synthetic systems, or &quot;protocells,&quot; are model  systems of primitive living cells and chemical examples of artificial  life. As <a href=\"http:\/\/grayanat.posterous.com\/?tag=martinhanczyc\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Armstrong puts it<\/a>: &quot;Although the protocell model system is just a chemically modified oil droplet, its dynamics are astonishingly varied and complex.&quot; <\/p><p>He&#39;s based at the Institute of Physics and Chemistry and the Center for Fundamental  Living Technology (FLinT) in Denmark. He is also an Honorary Senior  Lecturer at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College  London. <\/p>","slug":"martin_hanczyc","published_at":"2011-11-06 15:28:00","updated_at":"2011-11-07 15:52:03"}}
