And not just the beautiful, photogenic aspects of that design either.<\/strong> After a harrowing breakdown in the Sahara with one water bottle to share among four people, Bellows was forced to make a rendezvous via camel ride, and became certain that this animal was, in addition to being a &quot;mean son-of-a-bitch,&quot; the most perfectly designed creature on Earth.<br \/><br \/>Convinced by the organizers that <strong>bringing a live camel to the TED Conference was not a wise idea<\/strong>, Bellows did the next best thing, and drafted a National Geographic film crew to go to the Washington Zoo. They returned with a film of Suki, a 2,000-pound creature in the midst of rut, with shocking capabilities lurking in his spinning tail and rear-facing genitalia, all gleefully outlined in the film. But though this creature may seem unsavory, he&#39;s perfectly adapted to survival in the harshest environments around, and critical to the survival of the nomads that call the desert home.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"keith_bellows","published_at":"2008-09-15 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-09-01 15:36:49"}}
