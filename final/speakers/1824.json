This factor is a relentless yet stylish drive to accomplish something significant, to make a difference, to fulfill a vision -- in a big way. It&#39;s inexorable. Ma&ntilde;es Rubio recontextualizes the common and overlooked in our society and reveals it to us in a way that makes us know more about what we thought we already understood. And he does it with a warmth or humour that includes us -- not excludes or demeans. There&#39;s a compassionate, shared, embracing energy to his art. It draws us in, makes us more aware and more human.<\/p>","slug":"jorge_man_es_rubio","published_at":"2014-03-17 18:32:00","updated_at":"2021-05-24 12:46:23"}}
