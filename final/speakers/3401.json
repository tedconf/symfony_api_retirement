His passion for nature and photography have come together to create <a href=\"http:\/\/microsculpture.net\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Microsculpture<\/em><\/a>. For the project, a unique photographic process composites thousands of images using multiple lighting setups to create the final insect portraits. Each specimen was mounted on an adapted microscope stage, allowing close control over the position of the specimen in front of the camera lens. Most insects were photographed in about 30 sections, each section lit differently with strobe lights to accentuate the microsculpture of that particular area of the body. Each insect portrait is created from more than 8,000 separate images. In between his insect projects, Biss continues to photograph humans.<\/p>","slug":"levon_biss","published_at":"2017-03-20 13:58:00","updated_at":"2017-09-15 21:22:10"}}
