Soon he'll simulate a whole rat brain in real time.","whylisten":"<p>In the microscopic, yet-uncharted circuitry of the cortex, Henry Markram is perhaps the most ambitious -- and our most promising -- frontiersman. Backed by the extraordinary power of the IBM Blue Gene supercomputing architecture, which can perform hundreds of trillions of calculations per second, he&#39;s using <strong>complex models to precisely simulate the neocortical column<\/strong> (and its tens of millions of neural connections) in 3D. <br \/><br \/>Though the aim of Blue Brain research is mainly biomedical, it has been <strong>edging up on some deep, contentious philosophical questions about the mind<\/strong> -- &quot;Can a robot think?&quot; and &quot;Can consciousness be reduced to mechanical components?&quot; -- the consequence of which Markram is well aware: Asked by <em>Seed Magazine<\/em> what a simulation of a full brain might do, he answered, &quot;Everything. I mean <strong>everything<\/strong>&quot; -- with a grin.<br \/><br \/>Now, with a successful proof-of-concept for simulation in hand (the project&#39;s first phase was completed in 2007), Markram is looking toward a future where <strong>brains might be modeled even down to the molecular and genetic level<\/strong>. Computing power marching rightward and up along the graph of Moore&#39;s Law, Markram is sure to be at the forefront as answers to the mysteries of cognition emerge.<\/p>","slug":"henry_markram","published_at":"2009-03-17 21:06:00","updated_at":"2009-10-15 09:37:06"}}
