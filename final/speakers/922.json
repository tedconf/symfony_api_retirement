Experiential in nature, the result is sculpture that shifts from being an object you look at, to something you can get lost in.<br \/><br \/>Recent prominent works include &ldquo;Her Secret is Patience&rdquo;, which spans two city blocks in downtown Phoenix,&nbsp; &ldquo;Water Sky Garden&rdquo;, which premiered for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, and &ldquo;She Changes&rdquo;, which transformed a waterfront plaza in Porto, Portugal.&nbsp; Her newest commission creates a &ldquo;Zone of Recomposure&rdquo; in the new Terminal 2 at San Francisco International Airport. Upcoming projects include the remaking of Dilworth Plaza in front of Philadelphia City Hall -- turning it into a garden of dry-mist.<\/p>","slug":"janet_echelman","published_at":"2011-01-04 00:32:00","updated_at":"2022-03-18 02:31:49"}}
