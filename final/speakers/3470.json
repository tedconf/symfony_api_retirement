In 2014, she and her dad were sitting on a couch in a psychiatric hospital in Atlanta, GA. He looked at her and said, &quot;I&rsquo;m gonna be lost after this. After this, I&rsquo;m gonna be gone.&quot; In August 2017, her dad passed away from frontotemporal lobe dementia -- just two months after she gave her TED Talk. It was a good death.<\/p>","slug":"beth_malone","published_at":"2017-06-05 18:57:00","updated_at":"2017-11-16 15:21:00"}}
