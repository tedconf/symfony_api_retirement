","whylisten":"<p>We all have some measure of stress, and Robert Sapolsky explores its causes as well as its effects on our bodies (his lab was among the first to document the damage that stress can do to our hippocampus). In his research, he follows a population of wild baboons in Kenya, who experience stress very similarly to the way humans do. By measuring hormone levels and stress-related diseases in each primate, he determines their relative stress, looking for patterns in personality and social behavior that might contribute. These exercises have given Sapolsky amazing insight into all primate social behavior, including our own. <br \/> <br \/>He has been called &quot;one of the best scientist-writers of our time&quot; by Oliver Sacks. Sapolsky has produced, in addition to numerous scientific papers, books for broader audiences, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0743202414\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0743202414&amp;linkId=c77042a21ca8162d0b8867853526b5ba\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Primate&rsquo;s Memoir: A Neuroscientist&rsquo;s Unconventional Life Among the Baboons<\/em><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0716732106\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0716732106&amp;linkId=466047943345bdcc5ce51672dac5622a\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why Zebras Don&rsquo;t Get Ulcers: Stress Disease and Coping<\/em><\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0684838915\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0684838915&amp;linkId=4ac5199f220a51cbe9c2088318a7657a\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Trouble with Testosterone<\/em><\/a>.<\/p><p>His latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/hClRR\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst<\/em><\/a>, examines human behavior in search of an&nbsp;answer to the question: Why do we do the things we do?<\/p>","slug":"robert_sapolsky","published_at":"2010-01-08 14:35:00","updated_at":"2017-05-04 20:26:49"}}
