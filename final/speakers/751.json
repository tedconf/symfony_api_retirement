Sebastian Seung and his lab at MIT are inventing technologies for identifying and describing the connectome, the totality of connections between the brain&#39;s neurons -- think of it as the wiring diagram of the brain. We possess our entire genome at birth, but things like memories are not &quot;stored&quot; in the genome; they are acquired through life and accumulated in the brain. Seung&#39;s hypothesis is that &quot;we are our connectome,&quot; that the connections among neurons is where memories and experiences get stored. <\/p><p>Seung and his collaborators, including Winfried Denk at the Max Planck Institute and Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University, are working on a plan to thin-slice a brain (probably starting with a mouse brain) and trace, from slice to slice, each neural pathway, exposing the wiring diagram of the brain and creating a powerful new way to visualize the workings of the mind. They&#39;re not the first to attempt something like this -- Sydney Brenner won a Nobel for mapping all the 7,000 connections in the nervous system of a tiny worm, C. elegans. But that took his team a dozen years, and the worm only had 302 nerve cells. One of Seung&#39;s breakthroughs is in using advanced imagining and AI to handle the crushing amount of data that a mouse brain will yield and turn it into richly visual maps that show the passageways of thought and sensation.<\/p>","slug":"sebastian_seung","published_at":"2010-09-28 01:00:00","updated_at":"2010-09-28 17:13:09"}}
