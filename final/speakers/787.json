Toomey became a certified diver at the age of 12, and, as an adult, has logged dives all over the world, including Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, Latin America, and extensively in the kelp forests of California<\/p>","slug":"jim_toomey","published_at":"2010-08-24 18:48:00","updated_at":"2015-10-10 01:58:47"}}
