His riveting photographs, as beautiful as they are horrifying, capture views of the Earth altered by mankind.","whylisten":"<p>To describe Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky&#39;s work in a single adjective, you have to speak French: <em>jolie-laide.<\/em> His images of scarred landscapes -- from mountains of tires to rivers of bright orange waste from a nickel mine -- are eerily pretty yet ugly at the same time. Burtynsky&#39;s large-format color photographs explore the impact of humanity&#39;s expanding footprint and the substantial ways in which we&#39;re reshaping the surface of the planet. His images powerfully alter the way we think about the world and our place in it. <\/p><p>With his blessing and encouragement, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldchanging.com\/archives\/\/006356.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WorldChanging.com\">WorldChanging.com<\/a>  and others use his work to inspire ongoing global conversations about sustainable living. Burtynsky&#39;s photographs are included in the collections of over 50 museums around the world, including the Tate, London and the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York City. A large-format book, 2003&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/yalepress.yale.edu\/yupbooks\/book.asp?isbn=0300099436\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Manufactured Landscapes,<\/em><\/a> collected his work, and in 2007, a documentary based on his photography, also called <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/manulandscapesdoc\" target=\"_blank\">Manufactured Landscapes<\/a>,<\/em> debuted at the Toronto Film Festival before going on to screen at Sundance and elsewhere. It was released on DVD in March 2007. In 2008, after giving a talk at the&nbsp;Long Now Foundation, Burtynsky proposed &quot;The 10,000 Year Gallery,&quot; which could house art to be curated over thousands of years preserved through carbon transfers in an effort to reflect the attitudes and changes of the world over time.&nbsp;<\/p><p>When Burtynsky accepted his 2005 <a href=\"\/pages\/view\/id\/6\" target=\"_blank\">TED Prize<\/a>, he made three <a href=\"\/pages\/view\/id\/109\" target=\"_blank\">wishes<\/a>. One of his wishes: to build a website that will help kids think about going green. Thanks to WGBH and the TED community, the show and site <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetthegreens.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Meet the Greens<\/a><\/em> debuted at TED2007. His second wish: to begin work on an Imax film, which morphed into the jaw-dropping film <em>Manufactured Landscapes<\/em> with Jennifer Baichwal. And his third wish, wider in scope, was simply to encourage &quot;a massive and productive worldwide conversation about sustainable living.&quot; Thanks to his help and the input of the TED community, the site <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldchanging.com\/archives\/\/006356.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WorldChanging.com\">WorldChanging.com<\/a> got an infusion of energy that has helped it to grow into a leading voice in the sustainability community.<\/p><p>In 2016, he won a Governor General&#39;s Award in Visual and Media Arts for his work.<\/p>","slug":"edward_burtynsky","published_at":"2007-02-17 16:59:00","updated_at":"2016-03-20 15:50:29"}}
