In a paper for Science in 1997, he and his team uncovered what he sees as a surprisingly universal law of biology &mdash; the way in which heart rate, size and energy consumption are related, consistently, across most living animals. (Though not all animals: &ldquo;There are always going to be people who say, &lsquo;What about the crayfish?&rsquo; &quot; he says. &ldquo;Well, what about it? Every fundamental law has exceptions. But you still need the law or else all you have is observations that don&rsquo;t make sense.&quot;)<br \/><br \/>A past president of the multidisciplinary Santa Fe Institute (after decades working&nbsp; in high-energy physics at Los Alamos and Stanford), West now studies the behavior and development of cities. In his newest work, he proposes that one simple number, population, can predict a stunning array of details about any city, from crime rate to economic activity. It&#39;s all about the plumbing, he says, the infrastructure that powers growth or dysfunction. His next target for study: corporations.<\/p><p>He says: &quot;Focusing on the differences [between cities] misses the point. Sure, there are differences, but different from what? We&rsquo;ve found the what.&quot; <\/p>","slug":"geoffrey_west","published_at":"2011-05-21 09:51:00","updated_at":"2011-07-26 15:14:26"}}
