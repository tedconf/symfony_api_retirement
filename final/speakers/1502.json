Since 1985, Denise Herzing has been doing just that, spending each summer observing a pod of Atlantic spotted dolphins that live in the Bahamas as part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/wilddolphinproject.org\" target=\"_blank\">Wild Dolphin Project<\/a>. The work allows Herzing to better understand the pod&#39;s social structure, behavior, communication and habitat outside the confines of an aquarium or research facility.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Perhaps most remarkable is Herzing&rsquo;s collaborative effort to design, build and use an interactive device to let humans communicate with the free-ranging dolphins.
