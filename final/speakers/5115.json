Her most recent focus investigates the teeth of <em>Australopithecus sediba <\/em>and <em>Homo naledi<\/em> from South Africa. Her ongoing research helped establish the phylogenetic position of these fossils.<\/p><p>Brophy also documents the paleoenvironments associated with the South African hominins and assesses how changes in these environments might have influenced human evolution. She works as an assistant professor biological anthropologist with a specialization in paleoanthropology in the Department of Geography and Anthropology at Louisiana State University.<\/p>","slug":"juliet_brophy","published_at":"2019-02-11 21:44:00","updated_at":"2019-03-01 16:15:02"}}
