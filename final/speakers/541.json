His starkly beautiful black-and-white photos, Lobo writes, reveal what it&#39;s like &ldquo;to be young, employed and alive in Chennai today, regardless of one&#39;s language, economic class or social skills.&rdquo; <strong>This follows the theme of Lobo&#39;s career: breaking down stereotypes while reframing the landscape.<\/strong> <\/p><p><strong>Since 2001, Lobo has been taking haunting stills of everything from Yakuza tattoos and the illegal organ trade to the Indian middle class<\/strong>. He&#39;s worked as a field producer on many nature-oriented shows for National Geographic and founded Mad Monitor Productions, a production company based in Bangalore and Washington, D.C. There&#39;s no scientific, economic or sociopolitical boundary Lobo isn&#39;t willing to cross. His intense fieldwork continues to illuminate his traveling (you can read about his journeys and see photographs on his blog) and a forthcoming book project.<\/p>","slug":"ryan_lobo","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2009-12-16 09:33:36"}}
