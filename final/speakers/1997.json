Now, he\u2019s building an underground park in her old neighborhood, where greenspace is limited.\r\n","whylisten":"<p>Dan Barasch is the co-founder and executive director of the Lowline, an underground park that is being developed underneath the streets of New York City&mdash;in the Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal. In use from 1908 to 1948, this terminal is now abandoned. The Lowline will be a one-acre park in a neighborhood where greenspace is hard to come by. The project uses innovative solar technology to capture light above ground and distribute it below, making it a space that can be used in all four seasons. Once a wild idea, the project got a big boost on Kickstarter, raising more than $155,000 for its development in 2012. The project promises to be the inverse of New York&#39;s High Line.<\/p>  <p>Barasch has long known that he wanted to make a difference, but for years, wasn&#39;t quite sure how to go about doing that. Before he left his job to work fultime on the Lowline, he led strategic partnerships at PopTech; held multiple roles at Google; and worked in small business development in New York City government. He also consulted for UNICEF in Nairobi and with the 9\/11 Survivors&rsquo; Fund in Washington DC. He began his career at the World Affairs Council in San Francisco, co-producing the weekly NPR show &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Your World.&rdquo;<\/p>","slug":"daniel_barasch","published_at":"2014-07-02 22:54:00","updated_at":"2014-09-10 12:56:28"}}
