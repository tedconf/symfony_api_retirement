Through her research at New York University she explores how small differences in perception, whether conscious or nonconscious, can have potentially major consequences. For example, in a series of studies conducted in 2009 Balcetis helped show that people who saw Barack Obama as lighter skinned tended to report voting for him in the 2008 presidential election -- and vice versa.<\/p><p>Her current work focuses on how video evidence can bias jury members differently and how our vision can work against us when it comes to effective exercise. Balcetis&#39; goal is to show that through our awareness of these biases, we can also overcome them, for an ever so slightly less daunting world.<\/p>","slug":"emily_balcetis","published_at":"2014-11-25 15:31:00","updated_at":"2014-11-25 16:28:37"}}
