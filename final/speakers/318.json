","whylisten":"<p>Dan Barber is the chef at New York&#39;s Blue Hill restaurant, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester, where he practices a kind of close-to-the-land cooking married to agriculture and stewardship of the earth. As described on <a href=\"http:\/\/chezpim.typepad.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Chez Pim<\/a>: &quot;Stone Barns is only 45 minutes from Manhattan, but it might as well be a whole different universe. A model of self-sufficiency and environmental responsibility, Stone Barns is a working farm, ranch, and a three-Michelin-star-worthy restaurant.&quot; It&#39;s a vision of a new kind of food chain.<\/p><p>Barber&#39;s philosophy of food focuses on pleasure and thoughtful conservation -- on knowing where the food on your plate comes from and the unseen forces that drive what we eat. He&#39;s written on US agricultural policies, asking for a new vision that does not throw the food chain out of balance by subsidizing certain crops at the expense of more appropriate ones.<\/p><p>In 2009, Barber received the James Beard award for America&#39;s Outstanding Chef, and was named one of the world&#39;s most influential people in Time&rsquo;s annual &quot;Time 100&quot; list. In 2014 he published <a href=\"http:\/\/thethirdplate.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>","slug":"dan_barber","published_at":"2008-11-24 19:13:00","updated_at":"2014-12-22 21:30:29"}}
