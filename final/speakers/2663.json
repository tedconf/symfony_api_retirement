This enables fighting genetic diseases (cutting out HIV, altering cancer cells) as well as, potentially, opening the road to &quot;engineered humans.&quot;<\/p><p>Because some applications of genetic manipulation can be inherited, Doudna and numerous colleagues have called for prudent use of the technology until the ethics and safety have been properly considered.<\/p><p>Doudna is the co-winner of the&nbsp;2018 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience, along with Emmanuelle Charpentier and Virginijus &Scaron;ik&scaron;nys.<\/p>","slug":"jennifer_doudna","published_at":"2015-09-23 17:34:00","updated_at":"2018-05-31 16:32:23"}}
