But what happens after that first year? Why doesn&#39;t the creativity continue? Mitch Resnick, Director of the <a href=\"http:\/\/llk.media.mit.edu\/mission.php\" target=\"_blank\">Lifelong Kindergarten program<\/a> and LEGO Papert Professor of Learning Research at MIT Media Lab, is making it his mission to help kids keep the exploration going. He and his team develop new interfaces to help students engage with technology, in a way that encourages them to create and experiment the way we did in kindergarten with paint. Some of Resnick&#39;s projects include <a href=\"http:\/\/scratch.mit.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Scratch<\/a>, which helps young users learn to code, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerclubhouse.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Clubhouse<\/a>, an international network of creative afterschool programs for underpriveleged students.<\/p>","slug":"mitch_resnick","published_at":"2013-01-28 21:58:00","updated_at":"2013-01-29 16:01:03"}}
