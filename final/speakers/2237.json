A blogger, a filmmaker, and a butcher's shop owner, the common theme linking everything together is his boundless celebration of humanity.","whylisten":"<p>&quot;Our purpose is simple: we are here to change the world&rsquo;s relationship to their food.&quot; TED Fellow Bassam Tariq does not have small dreams; every project he undertakes is a big plan to make real change. Hence the butcher&#39;s shop he helped to open in Manhattan&#39;s East Village is organic, halal, and specifically designed to encourage healthier eating habits and happier families.<\/p><p>In 2011, Bassam and his friend Aman Ali resolved to spend each night of Ramadan in a different mosque in 30 states around the United States -- and write about the experience. The result, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.30mosques.com\" target=\"_blank\">30 Mosques in 30 States<\/a>, was a celebration of the stunning diversity of the Muslim experience in America, and a celebration of individual stories worth telling. Similarly, his documentary, <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/thesebirdswalk\" target=\"_blank\"><em>These Birds Walk<\/em><\/a>, is a portrayal of real life for street kids in Karachi, Pakistan.<\/p>","slug":"bassam_tariq","published_at":"2014-10-05 18:52:00","updated_at":"2015-09-28 16:15:22"}}
