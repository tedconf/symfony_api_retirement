","whylisten":"<p>Before becoming the center of the Western cultural universe, Manhattan was Mannahatta, &quot;Island of many hills,&quot; in the language of 17th-century Native Americans. Using computer modeling, painstaking research and a lot of legwork, Wildlife Conservation Society ecologist Eric Sanderson has <strong>re-envisioned, block by block, the ecology of Manhattan<\/strong> as it was when Henry Hudson first sailed into the forested harbor in 1609. <br \/><br \/>The <a href=\"http:\/\/themannahattaproject.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mannahatta Project<\/a>  presents the eye-popping fruits of Sanderson&#39;s research, from the now-flattened hills of the financial district to the river otters of Harlem. The project&#39;s astonishing visualizations are realized by computer-graphics wizard Markley Boyer, and encompasses a book, a website and a 3-D map -- a sort of Google Earth of ancient New York. Plaques around town will commemorate a lost creek or habitat. Far more than a mournful look back at what has been irrevocably paved over, the Mannahatta Project is designed to <strong>inspire ecological sustainability for New York and for other cities<\/strong>. <\/p>","slug":"eric_sanderson","published_at":"2009-06-23 10:46:00","updated_at":"2009-10-12 09:20:51"}}
