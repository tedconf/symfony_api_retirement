The digital revolution is over, Gershenfeld says. We won. What comes next? His <a href=\"http:\/\/cba.mit.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Bits and Atoms<\/a>  has developed quite a few answers, including Internet 0, a tiny web server that fits into lightbulbs and doorknobs, networking the physical world in previously unimaginable ways.<\/p><p>But Gershenfeld is best known as a pioneer in personal fabrication -- small-scale manufacturing enabled by digital technologies, which gives people the tools to build literally anything they can imagine. His famous <a href=\"http:\/\/fab.cba.mit.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fab Lab<\/a>  is immensely popular among students at MIT, who crowd Gershenfeld&#39;s classes. But the concept is potentially life-altering in the developing world, where a Fab Lab  with just $20,000 worth of laser cutters, milling machines and soldering irons can transform a community, helping people harness their creativity to build tools, replacement parts and essential products unavailable in the local market.
