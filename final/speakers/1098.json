As a research scientist and instructor in medicine at Harvard and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, he and his lab are working to subvert cancer&#39;s aggressive behavior by reprogramming the cell&#39;s fundamental identity. A molecule they&#39;re working on, JQ1, might do just that. (And he&rsquo;s giving it away in order to spur faster open-source drug discovery.)
