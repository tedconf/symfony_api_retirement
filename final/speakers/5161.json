So she teamed up with her friend Mike Norton (at Harvard) to figure out how people could use money to buy the most happiness. She and Norton wrote a book called&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geni.us\/1qVOFj\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Happy Money<\/em><\/a>, which presents five research-based principles designed to help individuals and organizations use their money in happier ways. It was selected by the <em>Washington Post<\/em> as one of the &quot;top 20 books every leader should read.&quot;<\/p><p>Recently, her work has focused on how people navigate trade-offs between time and money, and how mobile technology can both support and undermine human happiness. Dunn is an avid skier and surfer, and she survived a shark attack.<\/p>","slug":"elizabeth_dunn","published_at":"2019-02-21 17:42:00","updated_at":"2019-04-25 20:53:14"}}
