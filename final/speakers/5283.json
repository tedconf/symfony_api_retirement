Her training at the intersection of social psychology and law taught her that facts are rarely altogether factual, answers are seldom black and white, and the most fascinating explanations happen in that gray area in between. It&#39;s a mess in there, but it&#39;s worth it.<\/p><p>Georges is an assistant professor in Creighton University&#39;s doctoral program in interdisciplinary leadership, where she challenges herself and her students to explore complex, real-world problems and create data-driven and interesting solutions. As a leadership and research methods professor, Georges has been recognized as an award-winning educator and advisor by her students and peers.<\/p>","slug":"leah_georges","published_at":"2019-04-23 19:33:00","updated_at":"2019-04-24 13:03:23"}}
