His work has exciting implications for design and manufacturing -- and serves as a window to understand our own behavior and evolution.","whylisten":"<p>To say that Hod Lipson and <a href=\"http:\/\/ccsl.mae.cornell.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">his team at Cornell<\/a>  build robots is not completely accurate: They may simply set out a pile of virtual robot parts, devise some rules for assembly, and see what the parts build themselves into. They&#39;ve created robots that decide for themselves how they want to walk; <strong>robots that develop a sense of what they look like<\/strong>; even robots that can, through trial and error, construct other robots just like themselves. <\/p><p>Working across disciplines -- <strong>physics, computer science, math, biology and several flavors of engineer<\/strong> -- the team studies techniques for self-assembly and evolution that have great implications for fields such as micro-manufacturing -- allowing tiny pieces to assemble themselves at scales heretofore impossible -- and extreme custom manufacturing (in other words, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fabathome.org\" target=\"_blank\">3-D printers<\/a>  for the home). <\/p><p>His lab&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/ccsl.mae.cornell.edu\/outreach\/\" target=\"_blank\">Outreach<\/a>  page is a funhouse of tools and instructions, including the amazing <a href=\"http:\/\/ccsl.mae.cornell.edu\/outreach\/golemathome.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Golem@Home<\/a>  -- a self-assembling virtual robot who lives in your screensaver. <\/p>","slug":"hod_lipson","published_at":"2007-10-11 02:47:00","updated_at":"2008-06-22 02:30:24"}}
