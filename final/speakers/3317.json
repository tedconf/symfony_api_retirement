","whylisten":"<p>Gabriela Gonz&aacute;lez is a physicist working on the discovery of gravitational waves with the LIGO team. She was born in C&oacute;rdoba, Argentina, studied physics at the University of C&oacute;rdoba, and pursued her PhD at Syracuse University, which obtained in 1995. She worked as a staff scientist in the LIGO group at MIT until 1997, when she joined the faculty at Penn State. In 2001 she joined the faculty at LSU, where she is a professor of physics and astronomy. She has received awards from the American Physical Society, the American Astronomical Society and the National Academy of Sciences, and she is a member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.<\/p><p>Gonz&aacute;lez has been a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration since it was funded in 1997, served as the elected LSC spokesperson in 2011-2017, and is known for participating in the announcement of the discovery of gravitational waves in 2016. Her work has focused on LIGO instrument development (especially reducing noise sources and tuning alignment systems) and LIGO data calibration and diagnostics, critical to increasing the astrophysical reach of data analysis methods.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"gabriela_gonzalez","published_at":"2017-02-26 21:35:00","updated_at":"2017-10-03 12:54:47"}}
