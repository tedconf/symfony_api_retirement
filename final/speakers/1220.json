His research is directed at answering  questions such as: How are locations  represented, stored and used in the  brain? What processes and which  parts of the brain are involved in  remembering the spatial and temporal  context of everyday events, and in  finding one&#39;s way about?                      <\/p><p>To explore this space, he and his team use a range of methods for gathering data, including pioneering uses of virtual reality, as well as computational modelling and electrophysiological  analysis of the function of hippocampal neurons in the rat, functional  imaging of human navigation, and neuropsychological experiments on  spatial and episodic memory. <br \/><br \/>A parallel interest: Investigating our human short-term memory for serial order, or how we know our 123s.<\/p>","slug":"neil_burgess","published_at":"2012-02-06 15:52:00","updated_at":"2012-02-06 15:54:57"}}
