With a few flying balls and well-chosen props he will completely re-wire your notions of the physically possible.","whylisten":"<p>A high school dropout turned MacArthur &quot;genius grant&quot; recipient, Michael Moschen is an art juggler, spawning scores of imitators and an entire methodology of crystal-ball juggling he likes to call Dynamic Manipulation. (The previously mentioned imitators call it &quot;Contact Juggling,&quot; a term that Moschen himself despises.) <br \/><br \/>With a penchant for discipline, choreography, and catching flying balls -- and using props that include flaming torches, hoops, rods, and a ten-foot plastic triangle enclosure within which he stands, bouncing balls against the sides to achieve incredible patterns and velocities -- he creates illusions of speed and light that push the envelope of what is possible within this age-old circus art. Many of his techniques and routines are showcased in <em>In Motion with Michael Moschen<\/em>, a program produced in 1991 for National Public Television&#39;s <em>Great Performances<\/em> series.<\/p>","slug":"michael_moschen","published_at":"2008-05-08 04:00:00","updated_at":"2008-06-22 02:30:24"}}
