He's been a contributor to <i>GQ<\/i>, <i>Details<\/i>, <i>Salon<\/i> and <i>The Washington Post<\/i>.","whylisten":"<p>A Washington D.C. native and a current Brooklynite, Benjamin Wallace is fast establishing himself a master of <strong>the brainy nonfiction thriller<\/strong>, rooting up feuds and controversies in pop and less-than-pop culture while buddying up with their embattled and larger-than-life personalities (whom he sometimes meets on their way down). He profiled conserative mouthpiece Glenn Beck for <em>GQ<\/em> in 2007 shortly after the pundit landed a controversial slot on CNN, and in 2002 looked at chef Georges Perrier of Philidelphia&#39;s then-five-star restaurant, Le Bec-Fin. <\/p><p>Wallace&#39;s orderly, deadpan writing style hints at one of his secrets: his love (and talent) for <strong>playing the straight man to the once-mighty in downfall<\/strong>, right as they go aflame in tragicomic hubris. (<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/billionairevinegar\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Billionaire&#39;s Vinegar<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;is simply a pleasure, not least to schadenfreude junkies.) It&#39;s easy to imagine him, the bespectacled wallflower, watching as brouhaha over a wine bottle once valued at $165,000 -- the highest price fetched for a bottle, ever -- culimates in a court trial that reveals at least two of its main characters, a wine collector and a wine expert, to be frauds. Or at least emperors with no clothes. <\/p>","slug":"benjamin_wallace","published_at":"2008-12-15 14:37:00","updated_at":"2015-10-07 19:18:59"}}
