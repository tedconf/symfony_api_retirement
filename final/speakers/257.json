It&#39;s a fascinating field of study that had few empirical, scientific measures -- traditional clinical psychology focusing more on the repair of unhappy states than the propagation and nurturing of happy ones. In his pioneering work, Seligman directs the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Positive Psychology Center<\/a>  at the University of Pennsylvania, developing clinical tools and training the next generation of positive psychologists.<\/p><p>His earlier work focused on perhaps the opposite state: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Learned_helplessness\" target=\"_blank\">learned helplessness<\/a>, in which a person feels he or she is powerless to change a situation that is, in fact, changeable. Seligman is an often-cited authority in this field as well -- in fact, his is the 13th most likely name to pop up in a general psych textbook. He was the leading consultant on a <em>Consumer Reports<\/em> study on long-term psychotherapy, and has developed several common pre-employment tests, including the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foresightonline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Seligman Attributional Style Questionnaire (SASQ)<\/a>.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"martin_seligman","published_at":"2008-07-10 14:22:00","updated_at":"2015-09-22 18:28:00"}}
