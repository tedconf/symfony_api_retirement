Scott Fraser is an expert witness who researches what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s selective when it comes to human memory and crime. His areas of expertise include human night vision, neuropsychopharmacology, and the effect of stress and other factors on the human mind. He has testified in criminal and civil cases throughout the U.S. in state and federal courts.<\/p>  <p>In 2011 Fraser was involved in the retrial of a 1992 murder case in which Francisco Carrillo was found guilty and sentenced to two life sentences in prison. Fraser and the team that hired him staged a dramatic reenactment of the night of the murder in question and showed the testimonies that had put Carrillo in jail were unreliable. After 20 years in jail for a crime he didn&#39;t commit, Carrillo was freed.<\/p>","slug":"scott_fraser","published_at":"2012-09-07 18:57:00","updated_at":"2012-09-10 14:57:16"}}
