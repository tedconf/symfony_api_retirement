His newest interest: the tribes we lead.","whylisten":"<p>&quot;Seth Godin may be the ultimate entrepreneur for the Information Age,&quot; Mary Kuntz wrote in <em>Business Week<\/em> nearly a decade ago. &quot;<strong>Instead of widgets or car parts, he specializes in ideas<\/strong> -- usually, but not always, his own.&quot; In fact, he&#39;s as focused on spreading ideas as he is on the ideas themselves. <br \/><br \/>After working as a software brand manager in the mid-1980s, Godin started Yoyodyne, one of the first Internet-based direct-marketing firms, with the notion that <strong>companies needed to rethink how they reached customers<\/strong>. His efforts caught the attention of Yahoo!, which bought the company in 1998 and kept Godin on as a vice president of permission marketing. Godin has produced several critically acclaimed and attention-grabbing books, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/permissionmarketing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Permission Marketing<\/em><\/a><em>,&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/allmarketersareliars\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All Marketers Are Liars<\/em><\/a><em>,<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/purplecow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Purple Cow<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;(which was distributed in a milk carton). In 2005, Godin founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.squidoo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Squidoo.com<\/a>, a Web site where users can share links and information about an idea or topic important to them.<\/p>","slug":"seth_godin","published_at":"2007-02-13 11:16:00","updated_at":"2022-03-03 19:48:46"}}
