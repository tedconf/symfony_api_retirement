As she writes, &quot;I was born and raised in the Northwest, and I find my perspective heavily influenced by its laid-back, pioneering spirit. After earning my MA from the University of Washington, I intended to curate art, but fell into the unusual specialty of craft, which appeals to me as a way of living differently in the modern world that tells us something about being human; I continue to be fascinated by the place of the handmade in our increasingly digital age.<\/p><p>&quot;In 2014, after eight years at Bellevue Arts Museum, I moved to DC to join the Renwick Gallery. I attended my first Burning Man in 2017 as research for my exhibition &#39;<a href=\"https:\/\/americanart.si.edu\/exhibitions\/burning-man\" target=\"_blank\">No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man<\/a>,&#39; which explores the event as a creative laboratory and one of the most important cultural movements of our time. As a curator, I tell stories through objects, and I want to teach people to approach the world with curious eyes and find the magic around them. My work is as much about inspiring people as transmitting knowledge.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"nora_atkinson","published_at":"2018-02-17 14:52:00","updated_at":"2018-08-27 19:52:54"}}
