His computer programs <strong>scour the Internet for unfiltered content<\/strong>, which his beautiful interfaces then organize to create coherence from the chaos. <br \/><br \/>His projects are both intensely personal (the &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wefeelfine.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">We Feel Fine<\/a>&quot; project, made with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/~sdkamvar\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sep Kanvar<\/a>, which scans the world&#39;s blogs to collect snapshots of the writers&#39; feelings) and entirely global (the new &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/universe.daylife.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Universe<\/a>,&quot; which turns current events into <strong>constellations of words<\/strong>). But their effect is the same -- to show off <strong>a world that resonates with shared emotions, concerns, problems, triumphs and troubles<\/strong>. <\/p>","slug":"jonathan_harris","published_at":"2007-07-08 17:12:00","updated_at":"2009-04-08 14:35:55"}}
