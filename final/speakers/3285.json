Her social commentary takes the form of non-fiction, auto-fiction and poetry -- as well as sometimes quite strongly worded Twitter threads. A firm believer in lived experience as a legitimate source of knowledge, she often draws her broader political analyses from personal stories.<\/p><p>Adegbeye identifies as a de-colonial feminist, with a political praxis rooted in Womanist and Black Feminist thought. In deconstructing how power, social services, housing, capital and other resources are distributed and\/or denied within globalized societies, her ultimate goal is to reinscribe the intrinsic value of human life.<\/p>","slug":"olutimehin_adegbeye","published_at":"2017-02-17 17:26:00","updated_at":"2017-09-08 15:04:40"}}
