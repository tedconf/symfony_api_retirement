He applies physics and computer science principles to a wide variety of topics, like human intelligence, climate change and financial trading. <\/p><p>Lately Wissner-Gross started wondering: Why have we searched for so long to understand intelligence? Can it really be this elusive? His <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alexwg.org\/publications\/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf\" target=\"_\">latest work<\/a> posits that intelligence can indeed be defined physically, as a dynamic force, rather than a static property. He explains intelligence in terms of causal entropic forces, ultimately defining it as &quot;a force to maximize future freedom of action.&quot; <\/p><p>Wissner-Gross is a fellow at the Harvard Institute for Applied Computational Science and a research affiliate at the MIT Media Lab. He has a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard and bachelor&#39;s degrees in physics, electrical science and engineering, and mathematics from MIT.<\/p>","slug":"alex_wissner_gross","published_at":"2014-02-06 01:06:00","updated_at":"2014-02-06 21:48:45"}}
