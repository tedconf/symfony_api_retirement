To find out, Read Montague is imaging thousands of brains at work.","whylisten":"<p>Until recently, the world&#39;s curiosity about our brains seemed to focus on abnormal behavior. Which of course left a big question unanswered: Do we even know what &quot;normal behavior&quot; is? Through the landmark&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/roanokebrainstudy.org\" target=\"_blank\">Roanoke Brain Study<\/a>, Read Montague is hoping to find that out, exploring the everyday tasks of brains -- making decisions, understanding social context, and relating to others -- by neuroimaging some 5,000 people, ages 18-85, over a period of many years.<\/p>  <p>Montague&#39;s teams in Virginia and in London lead fascinating research in computational neuroscience (how the brain&#39;s &quot;machinery&quot; works), offering insight into the relationship between the social and cognitive functions. For instance, a recent study from his group found that in small social groups, some people will alter the expression of their IQ in reaction to social pressures -- revising, in almost all cases, <em>downward<\/em>.<\/p>","slug":"read_montague","published_at":"2012-04-30 16:27:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 18:31:13"}}
