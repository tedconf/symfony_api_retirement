She was originally trained in organic chemistry and immunology, and today her research group works at the interface of these two disciplines They recently made discoveries that link particular sugars that coat the surfaces of cancer cells with the ability of those disease-causing cells to avoid elimination by the human immune system. &nbsp;Now her research group is developing medicines that attack cancer cell-surface sugars so as to render the immune system more potent at eliminating disease. Bertozzi also studies other human health problems including tuberculosis infections and rare genetic disorders, using tools from chemistry to power biomedical research.<\/p>","slug":"carolyn_bertozzi","published_at":"2017-08-09 14:56:00","updated_at":"2017-08-24 20:55:01"}}
