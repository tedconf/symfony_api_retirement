His work focuses on the most common and widespread symbiotic relationship on earth -- between plant roots and a type of fungi found in the soil called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi improve plant growth by increasing roots&#39; ability to absorb phosphorus, while also boosting resistance to pathogens. <\/p><p>As Hijri points out in his talk, the study of AMF and a deeper understanding of them could have big implications for agriculture and could help divert us from an impending crisis -- that we are quickly running out of phosphorus.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"mohamed_hijri","published_at":"2013-10-29 13:42:00","updated_at":"2013-10-29 13:48:01"}}
