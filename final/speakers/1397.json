Little is best known for his work on the Parkinson&#39;s Voice Initiative, in which he and his team developed a cheap and simple tool that uses precise voice analysis software to detect Parkinson&#39;s with 99 percent accuracy. Little is a TEDGlobal 2012 Fellow and a Wellcome Trust-MIT Postdoctoral Research Fellow.<\/p>","slug":"max_little","published_at":"2012-08-01 16:01:00","updated_at":"2013-07-22 21:52:29"}}
