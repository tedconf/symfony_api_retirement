He was taken to prison and beaten &mdash; and died of his injuries. Sarah grew up angry, bitter and wanting revenge. But when later in life he met, for the first time, Jews who were not soldiers, Sarah had an epiphany: Not only did they share his love of small things, namely country music, but coming face to face with the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; compelled him to find ways to overcome hatred, anger and fear.<\/p><p>Sarah founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mejditours.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">MEJDI Tours<\/a>  to send tourists to Jerusalem with two guides, one Jewish and one Palestinian, each offering a different history and narrative of the city. Sarah tells success stories of tourists from the US visiting a Palestinian refugee camp and listening to joint Arab and Jewish bands play music, and of a Muslim family from the UK sharing Sabbath dinner with a Jewish family and realizing that 100 years ago, their people came from the same town in Northern Africa. MEJDI is expanding its service to Iran, Turkey, Ireland and other regions suffering from cultural conflict. If more of the world&rsquo;s 1 billion tourists were to engage with real people living real lives, argues Sarah, it would be a powerful force for shattering sterotypes and promoting understanding, friendship and peace.<\/p>","slug":"aziz_abu_sarah","published_at":"2014-03-17 18:13:00","updated_at":"2015-01-07 15:59:34"}}
