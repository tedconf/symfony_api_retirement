Gerdes&rsquo; research focuses on the development of driver assistance systems for collision avoidance, as well as on new combustion processes for engines.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Prior to teaching at Stanford, Gerdes was the project leader for vehicle dynamics at the Vehicle Systems Technology Center of Daimler-Benz Research and Technology North America. His work at Daimler focused on safety analysis.<\/p>      ","slug":"chris_gerdes","published_at":"2012-07-11 13:57:00","updated_at":"2012-07-11 14:29:41"}}
