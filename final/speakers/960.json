He has received worldwide recognition for his analysis of the Stuxnet malware.","whylisten":"<p>Ralph Langner heads Langner, an independent cyber-security firm that specializes in control systems -- electronic devices that monitor and regulate other devices, such as manufacturing equipment. These devices&#39; deep connection to the infrastructure that runs our cities and countries has made them, increasingly, the targets of an emerging, highly sophisticated type of cyber-warfare. And since 2010, when the Stuxnet computer worm first reared its head, Langner has stood squarely in the middle of the battlefield.<\/p><p>As part of a global effort to decode the mysterious program, Langner and his team analyzed Stuxnet&#39;s data structures, and revealed what he believes to be its ultimate intent: the control system software known to run centrifuges in nuclear facilities -- specifically, facilities in Iran. Further analysis by Langner uncovered what seem to be Stuxnet&#39;s shocking origins, which he revealed in <a href=\"\/talks\/ralph_langner_cracking_stuxnet_a_21st_century_cyberweapon.html\" target=\"_blank\">his TED2011 talk<\/a>.
