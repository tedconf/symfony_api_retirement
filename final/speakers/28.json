Each object he creates -- be it bottle, chair, staircase or car -- is reduced to its essential elements. His pieces offer minimal forms of maximum beauty.","whylisten":"<p>Ross Lovegrove is truly a pioneer of industrial design. As founder of Studio X in the Notting Hill area of London, the Welsh-born designer has exuberantly embraced the potential offered by digital technologies. However, <strong>he blends his love of high tech with a belief that the natural world had the right idea all along<\/strong>: Many of his pieces are inspired by principles of evolution and microbiology. <br \/><br \/>Delightedly crossing categories, Lovegrove has worked for clients as varied as Apple, Issey Miyake, Herman Miller and Airbus, and in 2005 he was awarded the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wtn.net\/2005\/summit\/finalists.html\" target=\"_blank\">World Technology Award for design<\/a>.
