Since 2015, he has been engaged with UNICEF and GreenLine Africa, advocating for climate action and serving as a voice for young people in Zimbabwe and Africa. Over the years, his passion for climate change issues, stemming from the continued environmental degradation of his hometown, has motivated him to participate in important climate change initiatives around the world. He travelled to the COP25 Climate Summit in Spain in 2019, where he joined children and young people from around the world in calling on global leaders to urgently address climate and biodiversity challenges. In February 2020, he participated in the sixth session of the African Regional Summit on Sustainable Development in Victoria Falls, making a passionate opening speech in the presence of world leaders including the United Nations Deputy Secretary General Amina J. Mohammed and&nbsp;President of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa.
