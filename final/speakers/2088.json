It&#39;s early stages for the device as well, but initial trials are promising. The open source device debuted publicly at the TEDGlobal conference in 2014.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Soto is a graduate of both Tec de Monterrey and Singularity University. In September 2013, he returned to Mexico to help the President&rsquo;s Office develop strategies and projects that encourage civic participation, transparency, accountability and innovation in Mexico, and improve the communication between citizens and their institutions.","slug":"jorge_soto","published_at":"2014-08-29 19:32:00","updated_at":"2014-12-09 14:00:25"}}
