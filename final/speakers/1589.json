It&#39;s fundamental science with an eye to practical applications as healthcare products.<\/p><p>Among the products from her lab: an engineered bone, cardiac tissue suitable for use in transplants, and disease-sensing nanoparticle aggregates that change color in the presence of even tiny quantities of cancer-related enzymes, making early sensing possible. As Stevens told <em>The Lancet<\/em>: &quot;It&#39;s right down at the nanoscience level. It&#39;s really exciting stuff, but it actually results in something very tangibly useful.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"molly_stevens","published_at":"2013-03-29 18:29:00","updated_at":"2014-02-18 15:54:02"}}
