As PETA wrote when awarding her a 2004 Proggy: &ldquo;Dr. Grandin&#39;s improvements to animal-handling systems found in slaughterhouses have decreased the amount of fear and pain that animals experience in their final hours, and she is widely considered the world&#39;s leading expert on the welfare of cattle and pigs.&rdquo; In 2010, Time Magazine listed her as one of its most Important People of the Year. She is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<\/p><p>Grandin&rsquo;s books about her interior life as an autistic person have increased the world&#39;s understanding of the condition with personal immediacy -- and with import, as rates of autism diagnosis rise. She is revered by animal rights groups and members of autistic community, perhaps because in both regards she is a voice for those who are sometimes challenged to make themselves heard.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"temple_grandin","published_at":"2009-12-09 16:03:00","updated_at":"2016-04-25 14:59:48"}}
