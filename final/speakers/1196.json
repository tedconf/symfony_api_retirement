He plays music on a laptop, using a specially designed blow tube as a computer mouse. Adoo says he&#39;d rather be able to play an instrument again than walk.<br \/><br \/>Lyn Levett has severe cerebral palsy and can only communicate by pressing an iPad with her nose, yet makes the &quot;most dizzyingly brilliant electronic music&quot;, says Hazlewood. Levett herself, through her iPad, tells us that when she&#39;s creating music, it feels as though she&#39;s in a cockpit, flying a plane. Sitar player and composer Baluji Shrivastav has been blind since the age of eight months, and Lloyd Coleman is both deaf and sight-impaired. All four make their living solely from music.<\/em><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thisislondon.co.uk\/lifestyle\/article-23997234-lets-hear-it-for-the-paraorchestra.do\" target=\"_blank\">Read the full story &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"british_paraorchestra","published_at":"2012-01-13 20:43:00","updated_at":"2012-01-15 15:29:36"}}
