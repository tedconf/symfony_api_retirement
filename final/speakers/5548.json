In 2001, he co-founded Minderoo Foundation with his wife Nicola, and he&#39;s since donated more than AU$1.5 billion to its core initiatives and more than 280 causes around the world. Never daunted by the scale of a challenge, Forrest devotes his relentless energy to tackling some of the world&rsquo;s greatest problems, including Indigenous disparity, modern slavery and cancer.<\/p><p>But it is Forrest&#39;s most recent pursuit -- a PhD in Marine Ecology -- that led him to the TED stage.
