{"speaker":{"id":359,"title":"","firstname":"","middleinitial":"","lastname":"Naturally 7","description":"A capella ensemble","whotheyare":"The group Naturally 7 practices vocal play -- the art of using the human voice to mimic instruments. It's as if a beatboxing troupe decided they could \"-box\" a whole orchestra: flute, horns, drums, guitar -- building a vocal wall of sound.","whylisten":"<p>The men of Naturally 7 can sing like a dream. But what you might not expect from this vocal group is what else they do -- their voices contain multitudes of instruments, from a glorious trumpet to a full drum kit (with a side of turntables). They call it &quot;vocal play&quot; -- the art of creating instrumental music with the human voice. It&#39;s an evolutionary step beyond beatboxing, which is a solo pursuit -- these seven musicians are a tight orchestra.<\/p><p>Naturally 7&#39;s sonic range is clear even by reading the member lineup: Roger &quot;N&#39;glish&quot; Thomas is a baritone and rapper; Rod Eldridge handles tenor, trumpet and scratching; Warren Thomas brings percussion, guitar and a third tenor. Baritone Dwight Stewart; tenors Jamal Reed and Garfield Buckley (who also plays harmonica); and bass Armand Hutton round out the group. <\/p>","slug":"naturally_7","published_at":"2008-12-07 17:54:00","updated_at":"2009-05-15 08:49:10"}}
