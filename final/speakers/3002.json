He&#39;s interested in the evolution of the atmospheres of planets such as Mars, Venus and Earth, and in particular how planets lose (and gain) atmosphere over time. He uses spacecraft data and computer models to help figure out how light and particles from our sun strip away atmospheric particles, possibly changing them from habitable worlds.","slug":"dave_brain","published_at":"2016-07-06 19:03:00","updated_at":"2016-08-12 14:49:02"}}
