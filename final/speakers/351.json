But behind the fresh design is a decades-deep commitment to sustainable ways of doing business -- culminating in the Mission Zero plan.","whylisten":"<p>Ray Anderson founded Interface, the company that makes those adorable Flor carpet tiles (as well as lots of less whizzy but equally useful flooring and fabric). He was <strong>a serious carpet guy<\/strong>, focused on building his company and making great products. Then he read Paul Hawken&#39;s book&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/ecologyofcommerce\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Ecology of Commerce<\/em><\/a>. Something clicked: with his company&#39;s global reach and manufacturing footprint, he was in a position to do something very real, very important, in building a sustainable world. <\/p><p>Anderson focused the company&#39;s attention on sustainable decisionmaking, taking a hard look at suppliers, manufacturing processes, and the beginning-to-end life cycle of all its products. (For example: <strong>If you can&#39;t find a place to recycle a worn or damaged Flor tile, Interface invites you to send it back to them and they&#39;ll do it for you.<\/strong>) They call this drive Mission Zero: &quot;our promise to eliminate any negative impact our company may have on the environment by the year 2020.&quot;<\/p><p>Anderson, who died in August 2011, estimated that since 2001 <strong>he&#39;d given more than 1,000 speeches making the business case for sustainability<\/strong>. He often ended his talks with the poem &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ted.com\/2009\/02\/04\/tomorrows_child\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tomorrow&#39;s Child<\/a>,&quot; written by an Interface employee, Glenn Thomas. <\/p>","slug":"ray_anderson","published_at":"2009-05-18 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-09-26 01:31:05"}}
