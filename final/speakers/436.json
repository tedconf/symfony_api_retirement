His three-volume reference work, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/humanscale\" target=\"_blank\">Humanscale<\/a>,<\/em> <strong>explores the relationship of spine to chair and other &quot;human engineering&quot; data<\/strong> necessary for highly specialized workplaces such as a cockpit or a truck cab, as well as aiding in the search for the perfectly comfortable place to sit down. <\/p><p>In the 1990s, Diffrient turned his attention to the office task chair. Working with the company Humanscale, he drew up the Freedom chair, a self-adjusting chair that <strong>mixed advanced materials (such as a gel seat pad) with good old-fashioned sketchbook design<\/strong>. The Freedom chair was part of a late-&#39;90s revolution in design that turned expensive ergonomic office chairs into dot-com covetables. In 2004, Diffrient and Humanscale released the lighter and lower-priced Liberty task chair.<\/p>","slug":"niels_diffrient","published_at":"2009-04-21 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 18:32:47"}}
