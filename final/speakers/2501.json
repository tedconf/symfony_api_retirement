The issue is close to home for Nazario: When he was just shy of eighteen he was arrested for robbery and sent to Rikers Island, where he spent 300 days in solitary confinement before he was ever convicted of a crime. Now as part of the I-CAN (Individualized Correction Achievement Network) program, he helps those at high risk for recidivism get jobs and stay out of jail and prison.","slug":"ismael_nazario","published_at":"2015-03-10 20:39:00","updated_at":"2015-03-11 15:11:08"}}
