Their waggish humor, irresistible stage presence and &quot;panther-like reflexes&quot; have turned these jesters from openers into the headline act.<br \/> <br \/>While the Raspynis sling their share of unique props, their trademark maneuver is (perhaps) the strategic interlude: stalling difficult, dangerous stunts with quips, asides and even deliberate mistakes. The duo&#39;s arch brand of onstage chemistry often steals the spotlight from conventional juggling showstoppers. (Though, we should mention, they won&#39;t hesitate to use torches, sickles and machetes.)<br \/> <br \/>In recent years Friedman and Holzman have carved a niche on the business seminar circuit, electrifying corporate audiences with lessons on teamwork, balance, trust and -- if you happen to be the CEO -- mortal peril. <a href=\"\/index.php\/speakers\/view\/id\/109\">Sergey Brin<\/a> has remarked, &quot;They&#39;re the Google of comedy.&quot; So, welcome to Vaudeville 2.0.<\/p>","slug":"raspyni_brothers","published_at":"2008-02-22 01:00:00","updated_at":"2014-01-29 00:31:58"}}
