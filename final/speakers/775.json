As a child born into a family of artists, <strong>he naturally combined his love of science with his tendency for visualization.<\/strong> His first work was in architectural modeling, soon moving on to do scientific visualization for NASA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, before joining the AMNH. <\/p>","slug":"carter_emmart","published_at":"2010-07-01 08:52:00","updated_at":"2014-08-14 14:55:20"}}
