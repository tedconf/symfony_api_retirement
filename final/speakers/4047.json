As an infographics designer, editor and producer, McCall brings together three realms of experience to present, visualize and understand complex data. As a designer, he aims to find the natural shape of the data and sculpt it into something captivating and beautiful.

He is excited by the opportunities to pioneer new chart forms to communicate specialized data sets as the collection and generation of data exponentially increase.<\/p><p>McCall was the infographics editor for <em>Money Magazine<\/em> and a graphics editor for the <em>New York Times<\/em> before launching his studio. He has explored over one hundred countries spanning all seven continents.
