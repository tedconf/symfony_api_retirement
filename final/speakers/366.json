In his early work as a forester in Indonesia, he came to a deep understanding of that triple relationship, as he watched the growing population of Sulawesi move into (or burn for fuel) forests that are home to the orangutan. <strong>These intelligent animals were being killed for food<\/strong>, traded as pets or simply failing to thrive as their forest home degraded.<\/p><p>Smits believes that to rebuild orangutan populations, we must first rebuild their forest habitat -- which means <strong>helping local people find options other than the short-term fix of harvesting forests to survive<\/strong>. His Masarang Foundation raises money and awareness to restore habitat forests around the world -- and to empower local people. In 2007, Masarang opened a palm-sugar factory that uses thermal energy to turn sugar palms (fast-growing trees that thrive in degraded soils) into sugar and even ethanol, returning cash and power to the community and, with luck, starting the cycle toward a better future for people, trees and orangs.<\/p>","slug":"willie_smits","published_at":"2009-03-03 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-12-22 17:11:37"}}
