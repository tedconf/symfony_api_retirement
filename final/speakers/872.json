In 1998, he and his  wife, Marsha, started The Phoenix Commotion, a construction company that  builds affordable houses from reclaimed and recycled materials. Their mission is to divert landfill waste while creating sustainable  housing for single mothers, artists, and families with low incomes. The  Phoenix Commotion keeps labor costs low while reclaiming human  potential. They use an apprentice program to teach sustainable building  skills to individuals that volunteer or intern on the Phoenix Commotion  Crew.<\/p><p>The houses are energy-efficient, cheap and satisfying to build -- and wildly, effervescently creative. To the Phillipses, any material used in enough multiples creates a beautiful pattern -- so Phoenix Commotion homes are covered and decorated with salvaged materials of many stripes. Homes are built in concert with their eventual owner, who contributes sweat equity and their own artistic flair.<\/p>","slug":"dan_phillips","published_at":"2010-11-25 13:51:00","updated_at":"2010-11-25 15:17:55"}}
