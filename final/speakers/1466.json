With the help of assistants, he painstakingly painted his clothes, face, and hair to blend into the background of a demolished studio.<\/p> <p>Since then, the so-called &quot;Invisible Man&quot; has photographed himself fading into a variety of backgrounds all over Beijing. Spot him embedded in a Cultural Revolution slogan painted on a wall, or spy him within tiers of supermarket shelves stocked with soft drinks. Just as with Bolin himself, the contradictions and confusing narratives of China&#39;s post-Cultural Revolution society are often hiding in plain sight.<\/p>","slug":"liu_bolin","published_at":"2013-01-06 03:08:00","updated_at":"2018-08-30 13:01:37"}}
