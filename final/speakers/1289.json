Despite criticism that bioresearch should be left to the experts, the Brooklyn-based lab continues to thrive, providing educational outreach, cultural events and a platform for science innovation at the grassroots level. At the lab, amateur and professional scientists conduct award-winning research on projects as diverse as identifying microbes that live in Earth&#39;s atmosphere and (Jorgensen&#39;s own pet project) DNA-barcoding plants, to distinguish between species that look alike but may not be closely related evolutionarily. <em>Fast Company<\/em> magazine named Genspace one of the world&#39;s &quot;Top 10 innovative companies in education.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"ellen_jorgensen","published_at":"2012-04-26 14:58:00","updated_at":"2016-10-03 16:53:23"}}
