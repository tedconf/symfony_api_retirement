A  former Peace Corps volunteer and MIT graduate, Tim has worked in West  Africa, Latin America and Asia. He is a Martin Fellow at the MIT  Laboratory for Energy and the Environment, a Draper Richards Kaplan  Fellow, and was named an Ashoka Affiliate in 2004. His awards include  the 2007 Social Venture Network Innovation Award, and the 2009 World  Technology Award. This year, Design That Matters was  named the winner of the National Design Award in Corporate and  Institutional Achievement.<\/p><p>Tim and his team made a splash when they created the NeoNurture Infant Incubator, named one of TIME Magazine&#39;s  &quot;50 Best Inventions of 2010.&quot; However, the product wasn&#39;t a hit with manufacturers or with hospitals in developing countries and forever remained a prototype. Design That Matters learned an important lesson from the experience -- that good design must keep in mind who will procure equipment, who will be using it, as well as the myriad ways it could be used incorrectly. As Timothy says, &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as a dumb user; there are only dumb products.<\/p>","slug":"timothy_prestero","published_at":"2012-08-14 14:27:00","updated_at":"2012-08-16 14:36:20"}}
