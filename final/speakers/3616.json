As she writes: &quot;I work on areas called &#39;dead zones&#39; that are coastal waters lacking in oxygen in which animals such as fish, shrimp and crabs cannot live. I am also, since 2011, studying the long-term effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on coastal waters and Louisiana wetlands.<\/p><p>&quot;I fell in love with biology in the 8th grade and then marine biology in college. My education was not quite the typical &#39;academic&#39; training. I worked my way through college, beginning at a two-year college, a regional university for my BS and MS, then worked at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, Texas, for three years. My desire for further education sent me back to work on my PhD at The University of Texas at Austin. My first job as a PhD was at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, starting in 1983. I am now a professor and Shell Endowed Chair of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences at Louisiana State University.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"nancy_n_rabalais","published_at":"2017-09-15 22:05:00","updated_at":"2018-02-27 15:35:14"}}
