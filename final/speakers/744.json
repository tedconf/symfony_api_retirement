There, just before dawn in April 1775, American minutemen and British regulars squared off, firing the first shots of the American Revolution. It&#39;s a perfect locale for Nye, whose ideas on <strong>how the struggle for power shapes the lives of nations<\/strong> are required reading for diplomats worldwide.<\/p><p>His views on the blending of hard and soft power into <strong>what he calls smart power<\/strong> have relevance in the day of non-state political forces (like Al-Qaeda). Nye has done much writing on how the age-old diplomatic methodologies of hard power (military force and economic payments) and soft power (persuasion and attraction) have fused into smart power and a cogent and usable diplomacy. It&#39;s the subject of his newest work,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/futureofpower\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of Power in the 21st Century<\/a>,<\/em>&nbsp;which provides a pragmatic roadmap for a country&#39;s foreign policy to deal with the challenges of a global information age.<\/p>","slug":"joseph_nye","published_at":"2010-06-09 07:34:00","updated_at":"2015-10-04 18:51:07"}}
