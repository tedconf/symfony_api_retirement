In response, he started the Honey Bee Network and began searching the country with colleagues, often on foot, finding a myriad of inventions developed out of necessity. These discoveries are documented and often shared with the global community, just as pollen is gathered by the honeybee to the benefit of both. Since 1988, the network&#39;s database of original inventions has grown to over 12,000, and its newsletter is now published in eight languages and distributed to 75 countries.<\/p><p>Gupta also worked with the government of India to establish the National Innovation Foundation, which holds national competitions to encourage new inventors and helps sustain them through the National Micro Venture Innovation Fund. Through his efforts, Gupta has uncovered groundbreakingly useful devices such as a pedal-operated washing machine, a micro-windmill battery charger, a hoe powered by a bicycle, and many more. <\/p>","slug":"anil_gupta","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2010-05-06 12:22:10"}}
