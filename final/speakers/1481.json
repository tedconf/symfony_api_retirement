Initially he couldn&#39;t do even the easiest trick -- but after one week of practicing, he realized: I could be good at this. Very good. Four years later (and 10,000 hours of practicing), he took the title of 2001 world champion. And then ... he gave it up. Went to school, got a job. But he missed the passion of performing. He realized: &quot;I want to do <em>this<\/em>: Entertain, and bring excitement and joy to people with the yo-yo.&quot; <\/p><p>Returning to competition after six years, he won the 2007 World Yo-Yo Contest in the artistic performance category. After that, he started dance and acrobatic training to create a new form of performing and art. Imagine <a href=\"http:\/\/officeblack.com\/movie\/\" target=\"_blank\">a yo-yo performance<\/a>  graceful and thrilling enough to pass the audition for Cirque du Soleil ... while being fast and precise enough to pull a tablecloth out from under a stack of champagne glasses!<\/p>","slug":"black","published_at":"2013-01-07 02:47:00","updated_at":"2014-01-22 00:47:22"}}
