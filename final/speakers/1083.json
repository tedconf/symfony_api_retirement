She studies stellar magnetic activity and how stars influence a planet&#39;s suitability as a host for alien life. She is also an artist and works in a variety of media, from oil paint to sound. She got her taste for astronomy as an undergrad at Johns Hopkins, testing detectors for the Hubble Space Telescope&rsquo;s new camera (installed in 2002). She also learned to love the dark stellar denizens of our galaxy, the red dwarfs, which became the topic of her PhD dissertation at University of Washington. Nowadays, she works on NASA&rsquo;s Kepler mission, studying starspots and the tempestuous tantrums of stellar flares to understand stellar magnetic fields. She is particularly interested in how the high energy radiation from stars influences the habitability of planets around alien suns. Lucianne is also a leader in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a new  project that will scan the sky every night for 10 years to create a huge cosmic movie of our Universe.<\/p>","slug":"lucianne_walkowicz","published_at":"2011-08-11 15:44:00","updated_at":"2016-01-02 16:22:28"}}
