Their first production, &ldquo;The National Mall,&rdquo; a location-aware piece mapped to the Mall in Washington, DC, was described by music critic Chris Richards &ldquo;magical...like using GPS to navigate a dream.&rdquo; They went on to create similar works for Central Park in New York and for SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas, and are engaged in a long-term project of sonically mapping the entirety of the Pacific Coast Highway.
