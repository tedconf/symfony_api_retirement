In the mid-1970s, with his collaborator Amos Tversky, he was among the first academics to pick apart exactly <strong>why we make &quot;wrong&quot; decisions<\/strong>. In their 1979 paper on prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky examined a simple problem of economic risk. And rather than stating the optimal, rational answer, as an economist of the time might have, they quantified how most real people, consistently, make a less-rational choice. Their work treated economics not as a perfect or self-correcting machine, but as a system prey to quirks of human perception. The field of behavioral economics was born.<br \/><br \/>Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial prize in 2002 for his work with Tversky, who died before the award was bestowed. In a lovely passage in his Nobel biography, Kahneman looks back on his deep collaboration with Tversky and calls for a new form of academic cooperation, marked not by turf battles but by &quot;adversarial collaboration,&quot; a good-faith effort by unlike minds to conduct joint research, critiquing each other in the service of an ideal of truth to which both can contribute.<\/p>","slug":"daniel_kahneman","published_at":"2009-12-09 15:53:00","updated_at":"2019-06-28 20:39:09"}}
