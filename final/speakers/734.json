Before this, she headed a firm that worked on a new form of remote control that <strong>uses brainwaves to control digital devices and digital media<\/strong>. It&#39;s long been a dream to bypass the mechanical (mouse, keyboard, clicker) and have our digital devices respond directly to what we think. Emotiv&#39;s EPOC headset uses 16 sensors to listen to activity across the entire brain. Software &quot;learns&quot; what each user&#39;s brain activity looks like when one, for instance, imagines a left turn or a jump. <\/p><p>Le herself has an extraordinary story -- a refugee from Vietnam at age 4, she entered college at 16 and has since become a vital young leader in her home country of Australia.<\/p>","slug":"tan_le","published_at":"2010-06-09 08:14:00","updated_at":"2018-02-06 06:19:15"}}
