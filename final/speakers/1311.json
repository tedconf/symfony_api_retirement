Pankaj Ghemawat disagrees with both -- and his case, backed by data, can be convincing. His most recent book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ghemawat.com\/books.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>World 3.0<\/em><\/a>, based on extensive research and backed up with abundant data, explores the true face of globalization--and shows that the world is not one vast market, but many small, interconnected, discrete entities, with varying degrees of openness to one another. That even the most open economies are still relatively closed. That we live in a world of semi-globalization at best. Ghemawat also refutes the assumption that globalization leads to homogeneization. According to <em>The Economist<\/em>, <em>World 3.0<\/em> &ldquo;should be read by anyone who wants to understand the most important economic development of our time.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Ghemawat is a professor of strategic management at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.iese.edu\/aplicaciones\/faculty\/facultyDetail.asp?lang=en&amp;prof=PG\" target=\"_blank\">IESE Business School<\/a>&nbsp;in Spain. In his latest work, he explores another kind of networked economy--the cross-border &quot;geography&quot; of Facebook and Twitter followers. <\/p>","slug":"pankaj_ghemawat","published_at":"2012-04-27 16:42:00","updated_at":"2015-07-13 18:05:16"}}
