While it has no brain nor central nervous system, the single celled organism, Physarum polycephalum, shows a primitive form of memory, problem-solving skills and the apparent ability to make decisions. It is used as a model organism in diverse areas of scientific research, including biological computing, robotics and structural design. &ldquo;It is also quite beautiful,&rdquo; says Barnett, &ldquo;and makes therefore for a great creative collaborator. Although ultimately I cannot control the final outcome, it is a rather independent organism.&ldquo;","slug":"heather_barnett_1","published_at":"2014-07-17 15:06:00","updated_at":"2014-07-17 15:11:03"}}
