Through his organization, he has seen the success of robotic facial hardware that establishes eye contact, recognizes faces and carries out natural spoken conversation. Hanson hopes these robotic faces prove useful to cognitive science and psychology, and to the entertainment industry. <br \/> <br \/>A former Walt Disney Imagineer, <strong>this young entrepreneur and roboticist has been labelled a &quot;genius&quot;<\/strong> by both <em>PC Magazine<\/em> and <em>WIRED<\/em>, and has earned awards from NASA, NSF and Cooper Hewitt Design. If Hanson succeeds, he will create a socially intelligent robot that may even one day have a place in the human family.<\/p>","slug":"david_hanson","published_at":"2009-10-13 10:12:00","updated_at":"2011-12-11 22:05:03"}}
