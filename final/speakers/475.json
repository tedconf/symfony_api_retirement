Looking at food networks offers an unusual and illuminating way to explore how cities evolved.","whylisten":"<p>The question of how to feed cities may be one of the biggest contemporary questions, yet it&#39;s never asked: we take for granted that if we walk into a store or a restaurant, <strong>food will be there, magically coming from somewhere<\/strong>. Yet, think of it this way: just in London, every single day, 30 million meals must be provided. Without a reliable food supply, even the most modern city would collapse quickly. And most people today eat food of whose provenance they are unaware. <br \/><br \/>Architect and author Carolyn Steel uses food as a medium to &quot;read&quot; cities and understand how they work. In her book <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hungrycitybook.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Hungry City<\/a><\/em> she traces -- and puts into historical context -- food&#39;s journey from land to urban table and thence to sewer. Cities, like people, are what they eat.<\/p>","slug":"carolyn_steel","published_at":"2009-10-05 01:00:00","updated_at":"2017-03-13 17:39:33"}}
