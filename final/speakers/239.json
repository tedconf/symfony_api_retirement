He's also the inventor of the kids' construction toy Toobers & Zots.","whylisten":"<p>A modern-day creator of &quot;twittering machines,&quot; Arthur Ganson uses simple, plain materials to build witty mechanical art. But the wit is not simply about Rube Goldberg-ian chain-reaction gags (though you&#39;ll find a few of those). His work examines the quiet drama of physical motion, whether driven by a motor or by the actions of the viewer. Notions of balance, of rising and falling, of action and reaction and consequence, play themselves out in wire and steel and plastic.<\/p><p>Ganson has been an artist-in-residence at MIT (where the Lemelson-MIT Award Program named him an Inventor of the Week, and where his show &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/salticus-peckhamae.mit.edu\/museum\/exhibitions\/ganson.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gestural Engineering<\/a>&quot; is ongoing) and has shown his work at art and science museums around the world -- including the legendary &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/1prmca\/til_that_arthur_ganson_built_a_kinetic_sculpture\/\" target=\"_blank\">Machine with Concrete<\/a>,&quot; which will put on quite a show ... in 2 trillion years.<\/p>","slug":"arthur_ganson","published_at":"2008-05-27 07:32:00","updated_at":"2013-11-03 02:30:02"}}
