However, relapse is the most frequent cause of cancer-related death among children with BCP-ALL. Jayatilaka is&nbsp;studying the activation of pro-survival and drug resistance mechanisms in a subset of the BCP-ALL population that allow tumor cells to persist following treatment and cause relapse.<\/p><p>Jayatilaka is currently conducting research on understanding the complex pathways that govern metastasis, the spread of cancer, which is responsible for 90% of cancer related deaths. She recently discovered a new signaling pathway that controls metastasis and showed that by blocking the pathway, the spread of cancer can be slowed down.<\/p><p>Jayatilaka grew up in Sri Lanka and pursued her BS and PhD in Chemical and Bimolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.<\/p>","slug":"hasini_jayatilaka","published_at":"2018-07-17 14:46:00","updated_at":"2018-08-16 19:42:43"}}
