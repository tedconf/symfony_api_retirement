He is the director and cofounder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.matterdesignstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Matter Design<\/a>, where his work focuses on advancing architectural research through spectacle and mysticism. He creates new ideas by critically evaluating ancient ways of thinking and experimenting with their value today. This work ranges from an award-winning play structure for kids to a colossal system of construction elements that can be guided into place with ease by mere mortals. He is dedicated to reimagining the role of the architect, and his speculative work continues to provoke new directions for design in the digital era.<\/p><p>Clifford is also an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His most recent authored work,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.matterdesignstudio.com\/store\/cannibalscookbook\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Cannibal&#39;s Cookbook<\/em><\/a>,&nbsp;demonstrates his dedication to bringing ancient knowledge into contemporary practice with theatrical captivation. He received his Master of Architecture from Princeton University and his Bachelor of Science in Architecture from Georgia Tech.&nbsp; For his work as a designer and researcher, he has received recognition with prizes such as the American Academy in Rome Prize, the SOM Prize, the Design Biennial Boston Award and the Architectural League Prize for Young Architects &amp; Designers.<\/p>","slug":"brandon_clifford","published_at":"2019-03-01 17:51:00","updated_at":"2019-06-21 14:56:20"}}
