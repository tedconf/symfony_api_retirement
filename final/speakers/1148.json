As a hobby, he explores what music looks like ... in light, in shapes, in fire.","whylisten":"<p>Jared Ficklin is a Senior Principal Design Technologist at frog, where he builds user experiences for clients, playing with interactions including touch and multi-touch, and applying physics to enhance the user experience. A passion for music and making things introduced him to the hobby of sound visualization, which has led him on occasion to play with fire. (As Flash on the Beach puts it, &quot;Jared Ficklin&rsquo;s sonic experiments stood out for their individuality, drama and casual disregard for health and safety.&quot;) Every March in Austin, Texas, Ficklin organizes the frog party, a collective social experiment for a few thousand people attending SXSW Interactive. It&#39;s a form of playful R&amp;D for social technology. And he has spent 10 years helping fund, design and &nbsp;build quality free public skateparks for Austin as part of the Austin Public Skatepark Action Committee.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"jared_ficklin","published_at":"2012-01-05 15:51:00","updated_at":"2012-07-13 15:28:03"}}
