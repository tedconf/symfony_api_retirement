Alessandro Acquisti studies the behavioral economics of privacy (and information security) in social networks.","whylisten":"<p>Online, we humans are paradoxical: We cherish privacy, but freely disclose our personal information in certain contexts. Privacy economics offers a powerful lens to understand this paradox, and the field has been spearheaded by Alessandro Acquisti and his colleagues&#39; analyses of how we decide what to share online and what we get in return. <\/p><p>His team&#39;s surprising studies on facial recognition software showed that it can connect an anonymous human face to an online name -- and<span> <\/span>then to a Facebook account -- in about 3 seconds. Other work shows how easy it can be to find a US citizen&#39;s Social Security number using basic pattern matching on public data. Work like this earned him an invitation to testify before a US Senate committee on the impact technology has on civil liberties.    <\/p><p>Read about his work in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/31\/technology\/web-privacy-and-how-consumers-let-down-their-guard.html?hpw&amp;_r=0\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New York Times &raquo;<\/em><\/a>  <\/p>","slug":"alessandro_acquisti","published_at":"2013-03-27 23:44:00","updated_at":"2013-10-17 14:34:56"}}
