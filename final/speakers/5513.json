Her work has also found evidence that fat could be a new sixth basic taste -- seemingly registered by its taste, in addition to its texture and smell.<\/p><p>Arndal Andersen performs these experiments at her lab in Brabrand, Denmark, and as a scientist at DuPont Nutrition and Biosciences ApS. She does it with the ultimate goal to understand how our brain registers sugar and fat, to engineer healthier food without compromising taste.<\/p>","slug":"camilla_arndal_andersen","published_at":"2019-09-06 20:44:00","updated_at":"2019-10-10 21:04:39"}}
