An expert on agriculture and sustainability, Fresco shows how <strong>cities and rural communities will remain tied through food<\/strong>, even as populations and priorities shift among them. <br \/><br \/>A former UN director, a contributor to think tanks and an advisor to academies in Europe and the United States, Fresco has noted how social unrest is made worse by hunger, poverty, environmental problems -- and modernization. Responsible agriculture &quot;provides the livelihood for every civilization,&quot; Fresco says, but adds that <strong>mere food aid is not a solution to world hunger<\/strong>. She hopes that smart, local solutions for food production will improve war-torn areas and ease the pressures of regulations on production. <br \/><br \/>Fresco teaches at the University of Amsterdam, writes on policy and economics for the Dutch paper NRC Handelsblad and is also a popular novelist.<\/p>","slug":"louise_fresco","published_at":"2000-05-08 01:00:00","updated_at":"2017-03-14 14:41:33"}}
