","whylisten":"<p>Jonathan Rossiter is Professor of Robotics at&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Bristol,&nbsp;and heads the Soft Robotics Group at Bristol Robotics Laboratory. His group researches soft robotics: robots and machines that go beyond conventional rigid and&nbsp;motorized&nbsp;technologies into the world of smart materials, reactive polymers biomimetics and compliant structures. Because they&#39;re soft, these robots are inherently safe for interaction with the human body and with the natural environment. They can be used to deliver new healthcare treatments, wearable and assistance devices, and human-interface technologies. They wide impact from furniture to fashion and from space systems to environmental cleanup. &nbsp;They can even be made biodegradable and edible.<\/p><p>Currently&nbsp;a major focus of Rossiter&#39;s work is on the development of soft robotic replacement organs for cancer and trauma sufferers and on smart &quot;trousers&quot; to help older people stay mobile for longer.<\/p><div><br \/><\/div>","slug":"jonathan_rossiter","published_at":"2017-02-13 16:32:00","updated_at":"2017-02-23 01:30:08"}}
