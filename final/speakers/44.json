His 2004 book, ominously titled <em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/ourfinalhour\" target=\"_blank\">Our Final Hour<\/a>,<\/em> catalogues the threats facing the human race in a 21st century dominated by unprecedented and accelerating scientific change. He calls on scientists and nonscientists alike to take steps that will ensure our survival as a species. <br \/><br \/>One of the world&#39;s leading astronomers, Rees is an emeritus professor of cosmology and astrophysics at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ast.cam.ac.uk\/staff\/mjr\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cambridge<\/a>, and UK Astronomer Royal. Author of more than 500 research papers on cosmological topics ranging from black holes to quantum physics to the Big Bang, Rees has received countless awards for his scientific contributions. But equally significant has been his devotion to explaining the complexities of science for a general audience, in books like <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/beforethebeginning\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Before the Beginning<\/em><\/a>  and <em><a href=\"http:\/\/press.princeton.edu\/titles\/7115.html\" target=\"_blank\">Our Cosmic Habitat<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>","slug":"sir_martin_rees","published_at":"2007-02-13 21:37:00","updated_at":"2015-07-10 21:11:50"}}
