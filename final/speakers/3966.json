Sosik is an ocean scientist who uses tools like lasers and robotic cameras to figure out how tiny organisms in the ocean affect our whole planet.","whylisten":"<p>Heidi M. Sosik is a scientist, inventor and explorer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where she holds the Stanley W. Watson Chair for Excellence in Oceanography. Sosik leads a multidisciplinary team conducting long-term research on marine ecosystems and how they are changing in response to intersecting pressures from human activity, environmental variability and climate change.<\/p><p>During undergraduate engineering studies at MIT, Sosik became fascinated by the diversity of microscopic life in the ocean. This led her toward a doctorate in oceanography and a research career focused on discovery. Today she develops and deploys new technologies to see life in the ocean in new ways. Sosik is co-inventor of a robotic underwater microscope used by researchers around the world to study minuscule forms of life in the ocean and by coastal managers to ensure that seafood is safe to eat. Sosik has been recognized for her impact and leadership through honors including a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and selection as a Fellow of The Oceanography Society.<\/p><p>Sosik&#39;s bold plan to explore the ocean&#39;s twilight zone is one of the first ideas of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.audaciousproject.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Audacious Project<\/a>, TED&#39;s initiative to inspire global change.<\/p>","slug":"heidi_m_sosik","published_at":"2018-02-17 14:32:00","updated_at":"2018-06-08 14:43:41"}}
