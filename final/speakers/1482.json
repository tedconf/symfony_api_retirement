After winning two consecutive UK Beatbox Championships, he turned to live looping (recording and playing back audio samples in real time) as a way to layer his vocal ablutions into dance-floor-rocking <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/beardyman\" target=\"_blank\">hour-long sets<\/a>. He released his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beardyman.co.uk\/i-done-a-album\/\" target=\"_blank\">debut album<\/a>  in 2011 and has been rocking stages all over the world ever since. <\/p><p>Working with <a href=\"http:\/\/dmgaudio.com\" target=\"_blank\">DMGAudio<\/a>, Beardyman built what he calls the &quot;Beardytron_5000 mkII,&quot; a real-time music-production system that could be the solution to the problem of how to smash a dance floor using only your voice -- and how to compose and produce complex and highly nuanced electronic dance music in real time. &ldquo;There was nothing available that does what I need, so I was forced to make it myself,&quot; he says. <\/p>","slug":"beardyman","published_at":"2013-01-07 03:02:00","updated_at":"2014-01-22 00:47:14"}}
