Research into proposed geoengineering techniques could prove vital in the fight to protect our planet. At the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geoengineering.ox.ac.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford Geoengineering Programme<\/a>, Tim Kruger aims to assess the range of proposed geoengineering techniques to determine which, if any, could be both technically feasible and benign environmentally, socially and ethically.<\/p><p>Kruger, a James Martin Fellow at the University of Oxford, is a co-author of&nbsp;&quot;<a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10584-012-0675-2\" target=\"_blank\">The Oxford Principles<\/a>,&quot; a draft code of conduct for geoengineering research. It calls for geoengineering to be regulated as a public good, for public participation in decision-making and for disclosure of research and open publication of results.<\/p><p>In addition to his work at Oxford, Kruger is also CEO of Origen Power, which is developing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.origenpower.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">a process<\/a> that uses natural gas to generate electricity in a way that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<\/p>","slug":"tim_kruger","published_at":"2017-03-18 22:01:00","updated_at":"2017-10-30 19:17:40"}}
