Knowing how these large predators travel through pelagic waters will help us understand their role in the wider ocean ecosystem.","whylisten":"<p>Barbara Block takes a multidisciplinary approach to studying how large pelagic fish live and travel in the open ocean. Using novel electronic tags, Block and her team track large predators &mdash; tunas, billfish and sharks &mdash; on their ocean journeys. She also studies how and why muscle makes heat at a molecular level in fish. <br \/><br \/>Working out of <a href=\"http:\/\/www-marine.stanford.edu\/block.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford<\/a>&#39;s Hopkins Marine Station, Block and her colleagues run the Tuna Research and Conservation Center, a member of the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.topp.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP)<\/a>  program. Combining tracking data with physiological and genetic analyses, Block (a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant winner) is developing population and ecological models to help us understand these fishes&#39; roles in the ocean ecosystem &mdash; and perhaps learn to better manage these important food fish.<\/p>","slug":"barbara_block","published_at":"2010-10-06 07:34:00","updated_at":"2010-10-06 09:01:29"}}
