Within a dizzying pile of concrete, each apartment was carefully sited to have natural light and a tiny, private outdoor space for gardening. These themes have carried forward throughout Safdie&#39;s career -- his buildings tend to soak in the light, and to hold cozy, user-friendly spaces inside larger gestures.<\/p><p>He&#39;s a triple citizen of Canada, Israel and the United States, three places where the bulk of his buildings can be found: in Canada, the National Gallery in Ottawa, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Vancouver public library. For Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, he designed the Children&#39;s Memorial and the Memorial to the Deportees; he&#39;s also built airport terminals in Tel Aviv. In the US,  he designed the elegant and understated Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Masachusetts, and the Crystal Bridges Museum in Arkansas.<\/p>","slug":"moshe_safdie","published_at":"2008-02-18 00:18:00","updated_at":"2015-09-24 19:33:11"}}
