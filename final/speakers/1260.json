He&#39;s passionate about helping students understand (viscerally) how our brains and our neurons work, because, as he said onstage at TED2012, we still know very little about how the brain works -- and we need to start inspiring kids early to want to know more. <\/p><p>Before becoming a neuroscientist, Gage worked as an electrical engineer making touchscreens. As he told the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/03\/09\/ted-fellow-2012-gregory-gage-_n_1335259.html\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post<\/a>: &quot;Scientific equipment in general is pretty expensive, but it&#39;s silly  because before [getting my PhD in neuroscience] I was an electrical engineer, and you could see that  you could make it yourself. So we started as a way to have fun, to  show off to our colleagues, but we were also going into classrooms  around that time and we thought, wouldn&#39;t it be cool if you could bring  these gadgets with us so the stuff we were doing in advanced Ph.D.  programs in neuroscience, you could also do in fifth grade?&quot; His latest pieces of gear: the Roboroach, a cockroach fitted with an electric backpack that makes it turn on command, and BYB SmartScope, a smartphone-powered microscope.<\/p>","slug":"greg_gage","published_at":"2012-03-12 12:00:00","updated_at":"2017-10-10 14:44:46"}}
