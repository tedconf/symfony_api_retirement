Currently, she leads the Neurophysiology Lab of the Communicative Disorders Department at California State University.<br \/><br \/>Much of Shankardass&#39; work has been devoted to the use of an advanced form of digital quantitative EEG (electroencephalography) technology that records the brain&#39;s activity in real time, and then analyzes it using complex display schematics and statistical comparisons to norms, enabling far more accurate diagnoses for children with developmental disorders. She is also actively involved in public outreach to increase understanding of brain disorders as a board member of the Global Neuroscience Initiative Foundation and a consultant for the BBC Science Line. <\/p>","slug":"aditi_shankardass","published_at":"2010-06-24 08:35:00","updated_at":"2010-07-09 09:00:32"}}
