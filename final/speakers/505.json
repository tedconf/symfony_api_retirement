","whylisten":"<p>Writer Evgeny Morozov studies the political and social aspects of the Internet. Right now, he&#39;s working on a book about the Internet&#39;s role in politics -- and especially <strong>how the Web influences civic engagement and regime stability<\/strong> in authoritarian, closed societies or in countries &quot;in transition.&quot;<br \/><br \/>Morozov writes the much-quoted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foreignpolicy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Foreign Policy<\/a>  blog <a href=\"http:\/\/neteffect.foreignpolicy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Net.Effect<\/a>, and is <strong>known for debunking -- with facts, figures and sound research -- myths and media-bandwagon assumptions<\/strong> about the impact of the Internet and mobile technologies on politics and society. We all want to be cyber-optimists, assuming that free societies necessarily follow from free data. Morozov is careful to say that it&#39;s not quite that simple: yes, social change can be empowered by new tech, but so can the policies of repressive regimes.
