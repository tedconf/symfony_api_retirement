Sheena Iyengar looks deeply at choosing and has discovered many surprising things about it. For instance, her famous &quot;jam study,&quot; done while she was a grad student, quantified a counterintuitive truth about decisionmaking -- that when we&#39;re presented with too many choices, like 24 varieties of jam, we tend not to choose anything at all. (This and subsequent, equally ingenious experiments have provided rich material for Malcolm Gladwell and other pop chroniclers of business and the human psyche.) <\/p><p>Iyengar&#39;s research has been informing business and consumer-goods marketing since the 1990s. But she and her team at the Columbia Business School throw a much broader net. Her analysis touches, for example, on the medical decisionmaking that might lead up to choosing physician-assisted suicide, on the drawbacks of providing too many choices and options in social-welfare programs, and on the cultural and geographical underpinning of choice.
