The president of what was once the most expensive college in America, Coleman made a radical, controversial plan to snap the college out of a budget and mission slump -- by ending the tenure system, abolishing academic divisions and yes, firing a lot of professors. It was not a period without drama. But fifteen years on, it appears that the move has paid off. <strong>Bennington&#39;s emphasis on cross-disciplinary, hands-on learning<\/strong> has attracted capacity classes to the small college, and has built a vibrant environment for a new kind of learning.<\/p><p>Coleman&#39;s idea is that <strong>higher education is an active pursuit -- a performing art<\/strong>. Her vision calls for lots of one-on-one interactions between professor and student, deep engagement with primary sources, highly individual majors, and the destruction of the traditional academic department. It&#39;s a lofty goal that takes plenty of hard work to keep on course.<\/p>","slug":"liz_coleman","published_at":"2008-06-01 01:00:00","updated_at":"2009-06-01 09:16:23"}}
