To create his works Dettmer seals the object with varnish, then swiftly and deftly moves through it with an X-Acto knife until he comes out the other side, cutting away material to form something new. His beautiful carvings reflect how, in a digital information landscape, even the oldest forms of knowledge can be repurposed.","slug":"brian_dettmer","published_at":"2014-11-12 19:46:00","updated_at":"2015-02-06 15:42:12"}}
