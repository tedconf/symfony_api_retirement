Now in his latest book, <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/worlduntilyesterday\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The World Until Yesterday<\/em><\/a>, Diamond examines small, traditional, tribal societies -- and suggests that modern civilization is only our latest solution to survival.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Diamond&rsquo;s background in evolutionary biology, geography and physiology informs his integrated vision of human history. He posits that success -- and failure -- depends on how well societies adapt to their changing environment.<\/p>","slug":"jared_diamond","published_at":"2008-10-27 01:00:00","updated_at":"2015-07-10 16:45:56"}}
