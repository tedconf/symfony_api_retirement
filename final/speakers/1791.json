His fourteenth solo album, <em>The Last Ship,<\/em> features songs from his Broadway-bound musical of the same name.","whylisten":"<p>Premiering in 2014, <em>The Last Ship&mdash;<\/em>with direction by Joe Mantello, music and lyrics by Sting and book by John Logan and Brian Yorkey&mdash;is inspired by Sting&#39;s memories of the English seafaring community of Wallsend where he was born and raised. The story is set against the demise of the local shipbuilding industry and is anchored by a group of unemployed workers who take back the shipyard to build one last ship.<br \/><br \/>The constant throughout Sting&#39;s enduring career has been his propensity to evolve. From his tenure as lead singer and bassist with The Police, producing classic hits like &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; and &quot;Message In A Bottle,&quot; to his acclaimed ventures as a solo artist, Sting is one of the world&#39;s most renowned and distinctive musicians. <\/p><p>An actor, composer, author and committed activist, Sting, along with wife Trudie Styler, founded the Rainforest Fund in 1989 to protect the world&#39;s rainforests and the indigenous people living there.
