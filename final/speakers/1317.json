In 2005, she filed one of the very first requests under the UK&#39;s Freedom of Information Act, asking to see the expense reports of Members of Parliament. The request was blocked, modified and refiled, and blocked again...but the years-long quest to view expense documents, and the subsequent investigation, led to 2009&#39;s parliamentary expenses scandal. The scandal led to the first forced resignation of the Speaker of the House in 300 years.<\/p>  <p>Brooke worked as a political and crime reporter in the US before moving to Britain, where she writes for the national papers. She has published three books:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/heatherbrooke.org\/books\/your-right-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Y<em>our Right to Know<\/em><\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/heatherbrooke.org\/books\/silent-state\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Silent State<\/em><\/a>, and 2011&#39;s<em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.therevolutionwillbedigitised.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Revolution Will Be Digitised<\/a><\/em>.
