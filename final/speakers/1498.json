","whylisten":"<p>A former professor of design, Jinsop Lee founded the firm <a href=\"http:\/\/uncleoswald.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Uncle Oswald Is My Hero<\/a>, which produces clever iPod speakers from old telephone handsets. And we&#39;ll let him take it from here:<br \/><br \/>&quot;My design background began when I was 5 years old. My mother cruelly refused to buy me a Star Wars X-wing fighter, so I built my own from Lego. Yes, I was the traumatized little boy in the corner of the playground holding the multi-coloured Lego X-wing fighter. However, this did teach me an important lesson: You don&#39;t have to follow the instructions that come with the box. <br \/><br \/>As an adult, I started my career as a suit-wearing design consultant, designing stuff and strategies for large companies. I then spent a mandatory two years in the Korean Army without killing anybody. Then I began teaching English, which eventually led to a job as an associate professor of industrial design. Being a professor means you&#39;re designing the most important thing of all: students and the type of designers they will later become.<br \/><br \/>&quot;Now I am working on a series of short videos about industrial design. Each video follows a simple formula: the viewer must learn something new about design while laughing (or snickering) an average of two times per minute. It turns out the second criteria is much harder than the first.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"jinsop_lee","published_at":"2013-01-07 22:47:00","updated_at":"2014-02-21 17:12:48"}}
