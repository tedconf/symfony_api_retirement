By training dog owners in proper conduct (as much as he trains the dogs themselves), he hopes to encourage better relationships with dogs -- not to mention their friends and children, too.","whylisten":"<p>We may call dogs man&#39;s best friend, but according to Dr. Ian Dunbar, humans often fail to reciprocate. Dunbar&#39;s <strong>decades of research on hierarchical social behavior and aggression in domestic animals<\/strong> truly give him a dog&#39;s-eye view of human beings&#39; incomprehensible and spontaneous -- if involuntary -- cruelties.<br \/><br \/>Dunbar says <strong>we might break our unseemly, unflattering habits and usher in an &quot;era of dog-friendly dog training&quot;<\/strong> by coming to understand why dogs do what they do -- Is Fido misbehaving, or just being a dog? -- and the repercussions of our actions toward them. (We might foster better relationships with our fellow humans, too.) His Sirius Dog Training company focuses on training puppies to be playful, yet well-behaved. His second organization, Animalin, promotes games for dogs and puppies at an international level.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Dunbar has written numerous books, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jamesandkenneth.com\/books\/how-to-teach-a-new-dog-old-tricks\"><em>How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks<\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jamesandkenneth.com\/books\/doctor-dunbars-good-little-dog-book\"><em>The Good Little Dog Book<\/em><\/a>.
