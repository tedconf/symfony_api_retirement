He cofounded Red Ventures in 2000, just months before the dot-com bubble burst. The company weathered the storm; by 2007 it was ranked fourth on the <em>Inc.<\/em> 500 list, and in 2015 the company was valuated at more than $1 billion. Elias has cultivated an award-winning company culture, ranking as a &quot;Best Place to Work&quot; in Charlotte, North Carolina, for ten years in a row.<\/p><p>Elias&#39;s leadership style and personal life are deeply influenced by his experience as a survivor of Flight 1549, also known as the &quot;Miracle on the Hudson.&quot; He is devoted to using his platform to &quot;leave the woodpile higher than he found it&quot; -- spinning out multiple nonprofits from Red Ventures over the years, all of which are aimed at creating educational opportunity and economic mobility for under-served groups. In 2018, Elias launched Forward787, a social enterprise committed to raising and deploying $100 million to build businesses in Puerto Rico that compete with the world&#39;s top companies. In 2019, he launched a podcast,&nbsp;<em>3 Things with Ric Elias<\/em>, as a continuation of the learning journey he shared on the TED stage.<\/p>","slug":"ric_elias","published_at":"2011-04-22 14:22:00","updated_at":"2019-04-03 21:35:04"}}
