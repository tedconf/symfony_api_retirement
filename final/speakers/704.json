Painting pictures of changing marine environments, particularly coral reefs and the Isthmus of Panama, Jackson&#39;s research captures the extreme environmental decline of the oceans that has accelerated in the past 200 years. <\/p><p>Jackson&#39;s current work focuses on the future of the world&rsquo;s oceans, given overfishing, habitat destruction and ocean warming, which have fundamentally changed marine ecosystems and led to &quot;the rise of slime.&quot; Although Jackson&#39;s work describes grim circumstances, even garnering him the nickname Dr. Doom, he believes that successful management and conservation strategies can renew the ocean&rsquo;s health. <\/p>","slug":"jeremy_jackson","published_at":"2010-05-05 08:20:00","updated_at":"2010-05-05 09:16:00"}}
