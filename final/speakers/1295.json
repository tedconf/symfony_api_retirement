Colloquially, these orders are based on elemental forms: the tree trunk, the plank, the scroll, the leaf. Michael Hansmeyer is adding a new elemental form: the subdivision algorithm. He turns his math and programming skills to making ornate, organic, hyperdetailed columns generated from lines of code and then comped up in cross-sections of cardboard, almost as if they&#39;re being 3D printed. <\/p><p>His recent work with cupolas and domes is even more mesmerizing, like looking deep inside an organic form of near-unbearable complexity.
