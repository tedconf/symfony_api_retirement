How? <strong>By turning loose sand dunes into solid architecture using bacteria<\/strong>. A team at UC Davis has been looking at the microorganism bacillus pasteurii to solidify the ground in earthquake-prone areas. As Larsson puts it, &quot;All I did was to deliberately misapply their technology ... and to pump up the scale, and turn it into a 6,000-km-long wall that&#39;s made of sand and protects against sand.&quot;<br \/><br \/>After talking with Jason DeJong at UC Davis and with Stefano Ciurli, a b. pasteurii expert at the University of Bologna, Larsson put together a team at University College London to grow the bacteria and attempt to solidify sand. His Holcim Award-winning proposal is a complement to the Green Wall Sahara shelterbelt, being planted across the African continent. Larsson is now investigating how to bring the project to the next stage: a 1:1 scale prototype. <\/p>","slug":"magnus_larsson","published_at":"2009-06-25 12:30:00","updated_at":"2009-11-25 09:29:21"}}
