Are babies and young children just empty, irrational vessels to be formed into little adults, until they become the perfect images of ourselves? On the contrary, argues Alison Gopnik, professor of psychology and philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley. <br \/><br \/>The author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/philosophicalbaby\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Philosophical Baby<\/em><\/a><em>,&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/scientistincrib\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Scientist in the Crib<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;and other influential books on cognitive development, Gopnik presents evidence that babies and children are conscious of far more than we give them credit for, as they engage every sense and spend every waking moment discovering, filing away, analyzing and acting on information about how the world works. Gopnik&rsquo;s work draws on psychological, neuroscientific, and philosophical developments in child development research to understand how the human mind learns, how and why we love, our ability to innovate, as well as giving us a deeper appreciation for the role of parenthood. <\/p><p>She says: &quot;What&#39;s it like to be a baby?
