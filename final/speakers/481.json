By his own estimates, <strong>he&#39;s photographed thousands of everyday items<\/strong>, often arranging them into tableaux that are at the same time familiar and luminously alien. They reveal surprising details and prove that items have an inner beauty.<\/p><p>His book&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/3zSv\" target=\"_blank\"><em>X-Ray: See Through the World Around You<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;showcases dozens of these photographs. Despite the painstakingly technical nature of the medium (an image of a Boeing 777 required a patchwork of 500 exposures), they radiate from the page with stunning, phantasmagorical delicacy.<\/p>","slug":"nick_veasey","published_at":"2009-06-23 11:15:00","updated_at":"2015-10-10 01:56:47"}}
