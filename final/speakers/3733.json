As the Adult Teen Librarian at the Free Library of Philadelphia&rsquo;s McPherson Square Branch, this often means saving lives.&nbsp;<\/p><p>After witnessing drug overdoses firsthand at her library and the nearby park, Kowalski&nbsp;volunteered to receive training in overdose defense through Prevention Point Philadelphia and now advocates for training for other librarians and community members to learn how to administer naloxone -- a life-saving drug that reverses the effects of opioids -- to people in distress. Motivated by her personal experiences as the daughter of parents who have maintained recovery from opioid use, Kowalski&nbsp;is transforming her library into a safe, responsive space for her community that is able to help people with whatever they need in a supportive, judgment-free way. Kowalski&nbsp;is a graduate of Temple University&#39;s College of Liberal Arts and the University of Illinois School of Information Sciences.<\/p>","slug":"chera_kowalski","published_at":"2017-11-10 20:31:00","updated_at":"2018-06-05 14:51:21"}}
