","whylisten":"<p>The daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants, Kashfia Rahman grew up as a minority in a homogenous community in Brookings, South Dakota. When she was in high school, she noticed her peers frequently succumbing to risky behaviors as well as the ruthless burdens of stress and peer pressure. Working directly on peers at her school, she dedicated research to studying the neuroscientific and psychological processes underlying these behaviors, and how the environment plays a role in emotion-processing and cognitive functioning in teens. With the hopes of raising awareness to minimize the potential for engaging in harmful behaviors, she took her research to the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, a culmination of 1,800 students from over 75 countries sometimes described as the &quot;Olympics of science fairs.&quot; For her research projects, she was awarded first place in her category as well as was recognized by the National Institutes on Drug Abuse and the American Psychological Association.<\/p><p>Rahman is also a Google Science Fair finalist and a Regeneron Science Talent Search Scholar. Featured in the <em>National Geographic<\/em> documentary <em>Science Fair<\/em> for her dedication to science research, Rahman is passionate about sharing her pathway to research and strives to expand the platform for marginalized and disempowered voices. She is also interested in bridging the gender and racial gap in the field of STEM and in advocating for healthy environments to improve teens&#39; behavioral and mental health.<\/p>","slug":"kashfia_rahman","published_at":"2019-02-14 15:50:00","updated_at":"2019-04-11 15:00:27"}}
