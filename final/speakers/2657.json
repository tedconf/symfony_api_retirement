Sixty years on, the welfare state is failing its purpose and leaving people behind.<\/p><p>Hilary Cottam believes that a solution can be found in putting relationships squarely in the middle of it, and she has the examples and stories to prove it.<\/p><p>Cottam&#39;s recent award winning work includes: new systems to support an ageing population; a prison that reduces re-offending; new approaches to chronic disease and unemployment.<\/p><p>She has advised governments, companies and third sector organisations in the UK and internationally. She was educated at Oxford, Sussex and the Open University. She was awarded her PhD in 1999. She currently lives and works in London.<\/p>","slug":"hilary_cottam","published_at":"2015-09-23 17:00:00","updated_at":"2015-10-26 18:22:36"}}
