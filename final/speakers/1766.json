{"speaker":{"id":1766,"title":"","firstname":"Chris","middleinitial":"","lastname":"Kluwe","description":"Punter and author","whotheyare":"As a punter, most recently for the Minnesota Vikings, Chris Kluwe consistently set team records. As an advocate for equality, he proudly and profanely broke the NFL's code of omert\u00e0 around locker-room politics. He tweets a lot about World of Warcraft.","whylisten":"The following dispatch was received in response to TED&#39;s request for a proper biography:<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>&quot;Chris Kluwe grew up in Southern California among a colony of wild chinchillas and didn&#39;t learn how to communicate outside of barking and howling until he was 14 years old. He has played football in the NFL, once wrestled a bear for a pot of gold, and lies occasionally. He is also the eternal disappointment of his mother, who just can&#39;t understand why he hasn&#39;t cured cancer yet.&quot;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>TED has no further questions.","slug":"chris_kluwe","published_at":"2014-01-24 21:40:00","updated_at":"2014-05-22 14:56:12"}}
