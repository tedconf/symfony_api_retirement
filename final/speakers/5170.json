These self-morphing robotic origami transform their planar shapes to 2D or 3D by folding in predefined patterns and sequences, just like the paper art, origami.<\/p><p>Paik is an active promoter of soft robotics&nbsp;that combines multi-discipline engineering expertise.&nbsp;Her soft robots have commercial applications, including a robotic surgical tool and a haptic joystick that can render realistic force feedback beneath a user&#39;s fingertip.<\/p>","slug":"jamie_paik","published_at":"2019-02-21 18:08:00","updated_at":"2019-07-10 14:39:14"}}
