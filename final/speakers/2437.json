Driven by fearless curiosity, he taught himself to navigate by clicking his tongue and listening for echoes -- a method science calls echolocation, and that Kish calls FlashSonar.<br \/><br \/>In 2000, Kish founded&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldaccessfortheblind.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">World Access for the Blind<\/a>&nbsp;as a platform to teach FlashSonar, along with other methods that the blind can use to &ldquo;see&rdquo; and that the sighted can use to expand their awareness. Kish and many researchers believe that echolocation produces images similar to sight, and allows the visually impaired to transcend the limited expectations of society.&nbsp;<\/p>","slug":"daniel_kish","published_at":"2015-01-24 23:09:00","updated_at":"2015-03-31 14:44:05"}}
