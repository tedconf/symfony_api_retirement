Jacobson uses numerical models to study the effects of energy systems and vehicles on climate and air pollution, and to analyze renewable energy resources.","whylisten":"<p>Mark Z. Jacobson&#39;s research looks at the <strong>causes and effects of vastly complex processes<\/strong> -- the physics and chemistry of our atmosphere. He and his team at Stanford have pioneered new atmospheric research and analysis techniques that give a picture of the current state of our atmosphere, show what pollution from aerosols, ethanol, agriculture, and ultraviolet radiation are doing to it, and predict how these might affect the climate.<\/p><p>Jacobson developed the first interactive model showing the combined effects of gas, aerosols and radiative air-pollution on weather systems. He also discovered that black carbon -- the main component of soot particles -- may be the second-leading cause of global warming after carbon dioxide.<\/p><p>Jacobson&#39;s group developed <strong>the world&#39;s first wind map based on data at the height of modern wind turbines<\/strong> -- serving as the scientific justification for major wind farm proposals in recent years.<\/p>","slug":"mark_z_jacobson","published_at":"2010-01-21 12:04:00","updated_at":"2010-06-10 09:36:02"}}
