He is the Halford Mackinder Professor of Geography at the University of Oxford, UK. His work concerns issues of housing, health, employment, education, wealth and poverty.<\/p><p>In the press, Dorling has been described as &quot;that rare university professor: expert, politically engaged and able to explain simply why his subject matters,&quot; and as one who has made it &quot;his life&#39;s work to dig through the layers that make up Britain&#39;s human landscape, and then map it in ways nobody else had thought to do.&quot; Working with many others, he has done the same for all the countries of the world &quot;giving a strikingly different perspective from the Mercator projection most commonly used.&quot; All this mapping lead him to worry more about inequality.<\/p><p>His recent books include&nbsp;co-authored texts&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/AmKjZvL\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Atlas of the Real World: Mapping the Way We Live<\/em><\/a>,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/7oW0gBU\" target=\"_blank\">Bankrupt Britain: An atlas of social change<\/a>, <\/em>and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/9dKK\" target=\"_blank\"><em>People and Places a 21st-century Atlas of the UK<\/em><\/a>.
