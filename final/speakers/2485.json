His works include: &ldquo;SPORE 1.1,&rdquo; a self-sustaining ecosystem for a rubber tree, purchased from The Home Depot and watered in conjunction with Home Depot stock prices; &ldquo;Supermajor,&rdquo; a collection of vintage oilcans with droplets of oil that defy gravity and flow back into a punctured&nbsp;hole; and &rdquo;Notepad,&rdquo; a commemoration of the Iraqi civilians who died as a result of the US-led invasion, printed in the lines of what appear to be your average, everyday legal pads.&nbsp;<\/p> <p>Kenyon creates these projects through SWAMP, or Studies of Work Atmosphere and Mass Production. He teaches art at the University of Michigan&#39;s Stamps School of Art &amp; Design.<\/p>","slug":"matt_kenyon","published_at":"2015-03-05 18:08:00","updated_at":"2015-08-13 14:09:15"}}
