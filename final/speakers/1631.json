When he was a kid he followed his parents around reciting whatever new fact he had learned -- &quot;Haley&#39;s comet or giant squids or the size of the world&#39;s biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was&quot; -- to no end. And his natural curiosity paid off. Today Jennings holds the record for most consecutive wins on the trivia game show <em>Jeopardy<\/em>, with an astounding 74 wins. (At one point Jennings also held the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most cash won on a game show.&quot; Not bad for a trivia nerd.) <\/p><p>In 2011 Jennings participated in the IBM Challenge, which featured him and <em>Jeopardy<\/em> rival Brad Rutter in a match against IBM supercomputer Watson. Jennings came in second. Watson was first. But Jennings wasn&#39;t disappointed in his performance, As he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/arts\/culturebox\/2011\/02\/my_puny_human_brain.single.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote of his loss<\/a>, &quot;I don&#39;t have 2,880 processor cores and 15 terabytes of reference works at my disposal. ... My puny human brain, just a few bucks worth of water, salts, and proteins, hung in there just fine against a jillion-dollar supercomputer.&quot;<\/p><p> In 2012 Jennings published the book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/becauseisaidso\" target=\"_blank\">Because I Said So!: The Truth Behind the Myths, Tales, and Warnings Every Generation Passes Down to Its Kids<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>","slug":"ken_jennings","published_at":"2013-04-04 20:34:00","updated_at":"2015-10-10 01:50:35"}}
