Taking from this the lesson that every customer is unique, he wrote a book called&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/masscustomization\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mass Customization<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;<\/em>on businesses that serve customers&#39; unique needs. Later <strong>he discovered what he would coin the &quot;Experience Economy&quot;<\/strong> -- consumers buying experiences rather than goods or commodities -- and wrote a <a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/experienceeconomy\" target=\"_blank\">book<\/a>  of the same name.<\/p><p>Pine and his friend Jim Gilmore have since turned their focus to <strong>authenticity<\/strong>, which they argue is the main criterion people use when deciding what to buy. (The idea was featured in <em>TIME<\/em>&#39;s &quot;10 Ideas That Are Changing the World,&quot; and also became a book.) They joke that their company, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.strategichorizons.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategic Horizons<\/a>, ought to be called &quot;Frameworks &#39;R&#39; Us,&quot; after their specialty in helping others see business differently. <\/p>","slug":"joseph_pine","published_at":"2009-01-14 10:21:00","updated_at":"2015-07-10 21:26:26"}}
