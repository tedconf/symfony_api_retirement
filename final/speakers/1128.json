The idea is to be able to decode the activity, to look at a pattern of electrical pulses and know what an animal is seeing or thinking or feeling. &nbsp;Recently, she&rsquo;s been using this work to develop new kinds of prosthetic devices, particularly ones for treating blindness.<\/p><div><br \/><\/div>","slug":"sheila_nirenberg","published_at":"2011-12-20 15:11:00","updated_at":"2011-12-20 16:10:09"}}
