Her mission is to empower and elevate people through music and compassion.","whylisten":"<p>A vocal percussionist virtuosa, Butterscotch&nbsp;began her career in the underground male-dominated beatbox battle scene, where she was crowned the world&#39;s first female beatbox champion. She blends hip-hop, jazz, soul and reggae into shows that are emotionally and physically invigorating. Butterscotch is known for her&nbsp;trifecta fusion of singing, beatboxing and playing either piano or guitar simultaneously, creating endless layers on her loop station. With a voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday and rap verses comparable to Lauryn Hill, Butterscotch courageously sings about her love life, depression and daily struggles of being a biracial queer woman of color. Her philanthropic mission is to empower and elevate people through music and compassion.<\/p><p>Butterscotch has opened up for Erykah Badu, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Thievery Corporation, Sergio Mendes, Wyclef Jean and other musical legends. Her newest release, <em>Scotch<\/em>, is testament to her growth as an artist and human.
