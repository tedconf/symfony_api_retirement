He works in philosophy of mind and in related areas of philosophy and cognitive science. While he&#39;s especially known for his theories on consciousness, he&#39;s also interested (and has extensively published) in all sorts of other issues in the foundations of cognitive science, the philosophy of language, metaphysics and epistemology.<br \/><br \/>Chalmers placed the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness firmly on the philosophical map. He famously challenges materialist conceptions of mind, arguing for an &quot;explanatory gap&quot; between our brains&rsquo; physical properties and our minds&rsquo; qualia. Elsewhere he has championed the notion of the &quot;extended mind,&quot; which argues that the mind is not confined to skin or skull, but plausibly may extend beyond them.<\/p>","slug":"david_chalmers","published_at":"2014-01-28 18:00:00","updated_at":"2014-07-14 14:58:19"}}
