If she felt like jumping from a cliff, she did so without thinking of the consequences. As an older and wiser activist, she tends to balance risks -- but she still actively keeps an element of risk-free thinking when it comes to doing the right thing.<\/p><p>As cofounder of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/togetherwebuildit.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Together We Build It<\/a>&nbsp;Foundation, an intergenerational organization working to builds peace in Libya, Sharief promotes human rights, gender equality and political participation. Doing the right thing regardless of risk remains her life principle, and activism remains her lifestyle -- one that helps individuals become aware of their responsibility towards humanity and the environment.<\/p>","slug":"hajer_sharief","published_at":"2019-05-29 21:31:00","updated_at":"2019-07-22 09:12:52"}}
