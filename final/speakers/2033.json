The intent of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/mission-31.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mission31<\/a>: study the life of and on the coral reef -- and the effects of climate change, acidification, and pollution, in particular by plastic debris and oil spills. But it was also a study of the scientists themselves spending extended time underwater. By stayigng down continuously, they collected the equivalent of several years of scientific data in just a month.  <br \/><br \/> 50 years ago Fabien Cousteau&#39;s grandfather, the legendary ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, led a similar -- but shorter by one day -- expedition under the surface of the Red Sea. Since, we have explored only a very small portion of the oceans, less than 5 percent.  ","slug":"fabien_cousteau","published_at":"2014-08-12 20:18:00","updated_at":"2014-10-23 15:20:43"}}
