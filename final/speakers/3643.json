Her writing, accessible yet empowering, speaks to a greater future for all women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community, preaching love, acceptance, justice, peace, equity and equality.<\/p><p>Wade&#39;s artwork is founded on the idea that art should be in the name of all people&nbsp;and should serve all people. This idea has inspired some of her larger scale public art installations, including a 25-foot love poem in the skyline of the New Orleans French Quarter titled &quot;Respect,&quot; as well as her follow up piece, &quot;She,&quot; which was created in collaboration with graffiti artist Brandon Odums and is permanently installed on the face of a 50-foot warehouse building in the New Orleans Bywater neighborhood. In the summer of 2017, Wade created the &quot;ARE YOU OK&quot; project, a public booth for free, peaceful and loving conversation at the Hester Street Fair in New York City. Her latest public art installation of 10-word mantras on 46-foot screens entitled &quot;Show Love Spread Love&quot; is currently on view in Los Angeles on the facade of the Beverly Center. Other mediums of Wade&#39;s art include drawing, painting, sculpture, and neon text. Wade contributes regularly to <em>W<\/em> magazine and <em>Teen Vogue<\/em>.<\/p>","slug":"cleo_wade","published_at":"2017-09-17 16:30:00","updated_at":"2018-01-09 16:30:32"}}
