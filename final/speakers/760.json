Or, as CNN put it: &quot;In non-scientific terms, they grind up seed husks and glue the small pieces together with mushroom root.&quot; Their products include packaging and styrofoam substitute and the now-in-development Greensulate rigid insulation board for builders. Both products require less energy to create than synthetics like foam, because they&#39;re quite literally grown. Equally compelling, at the end of their useful life, they can be home-composted or even used as garden mulch.<\/p>","slug":"eben_bayer","published_at":"2010-06-09 07:34:00","updated_at":"2014-07-02 19:14:41"}}
