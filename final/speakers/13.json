Her discovery, at age 17, of a compound that stops fruit-fly brain cells from dying was regarded as a step toward curing Alzheimer's. Now she aims to find better ways to treat -- and avoid -- cancer.","whylisten":"<p>Eva Vertes may not yet have the answers she needs to cure cancer, but she&#39;s asking some important -- and radical  questions: If smoking can cause lung cancer, and drinking can cause liver cancer, is it possible that cancer is a direct result of injury? If so, <strong>could cancer be caused by the body&#39;s own repair system going awry?<\/strong>  <\/p><p>She asks this and other breathtaking questions in her conference-closing 2005 talk. <strong>Her approach marks an important shift in scientific thinking<\/strong>, looking in brand-new places for cancer&#39;s cause -- and its cure. Her ultimate goal, which even she calls far-fetched, is to fight cancer with cancer.<\/p>","slug":"eva_vertes","published_at":"2007-02-13 11:05:00","updated_at":"2016-11-29 16:34:29"}}
