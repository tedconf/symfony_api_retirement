In Kirby Ferguson&#39;s view, any piece of art that contains a recognizable reference to another work--a quote from a lyric, a borrowed riff, a filmic homage. Which makes almost everything a remix, from a Led Zeppelin song to a classic film from George Lucas. His deeply researched and insanely fun four-part web series, &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.everythingisaremix.info\/watch-the-series\" target=\"_blank\">Everything Is a Remix<\/a>,&quot; dives into the question: Is remixing a form of creativity, a production of the new on the shoulders of what precedes it, or is it just copying? He comes out firmly on the side of creativity, calling for protections for people who, with good intentions, weave together bits of existing culture into something fresh and relevant.<\/p><p>His next web series is called &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.everythingisaremix.info\/this-is-not-a-conspiracy-theory-is-on\" target=\"_blank\">This Is Not a Conspiracy Theory<\/a>,&quot; an attempt to explore how US politics came to be the way they are.<\/p>","slug":"kirby_ferguson","published_at":"2012-04-27 15:54:00","updated_at":"2013-07-22 21:45:00"}}
