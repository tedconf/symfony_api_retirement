He engineers enzymes for use in industrial applications, ranging from laundry detergents to animal nutrition.","whylisten":"<p>Adam Garske is a senior scientist in Nutrition and Biosciences at DuPont.&nbsp;He obtained a PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he created and used chemical tools to study enzymes and proteins involved in gene regulation. As an NIH-sponsored postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco, Garske&nbsp;studied protein kinases -- master regulator enzymes that often go awry in diseases such as cancer. He endeavors to synthesize his understanding of chemistry and enzymes to make a more sustainable world.<\/p>","slug":"adam_garske","published_at":"2019-09-06 20:43:00","updated_at":"2020-01-21 15:50:40"}}
