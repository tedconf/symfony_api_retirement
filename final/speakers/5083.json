More than half are from low-income families who have no early education options at all.<\/p><p>Claudia Miner and her team at Waterford UPSTART want to change that. They believe no child should start school behind their peers. Waterford UPSTART has one goal: to ensure that every child arrives at school on day one ready to learn.<\/p><p>As Miner writes: &quot;Twelve years ago, I joined Waterford.org after I heard about the organization&#39;s mission of serving children. It spoke to me in a way no other work had. Working with great people, we charted a course to serve children in the home to get them ready for school. This was a radical move -- especially since we were putting our faith in parents -- but it fit my beliefs and has become my passion. Parents have proven they are up to the task. Knowing I have a role in helping children set the stage for success in life gets me up in the morning with a great and powerful purpose.&quot;<\/p><p>With support from The Audacious Project, Miner&nbsp;and her colleagues are expanding the program to reach even more families, filling early education gaps across the nation.<\/p>","slug":"claudia_miner","published_at":"2019-01-10 20:19:00","updated_at":"2019-07-17 14:46:16"}}
