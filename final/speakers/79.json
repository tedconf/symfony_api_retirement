Twenty years later he felt the same frustration while working at a New York bank, using diskettes to share information during a computer network breakdown. His epiphany: In both cases, <strong>&quot;connectivity is productivity.&quot;<\/strong> Had he been able to call the doctor, it would have saved him hours of walking for nothing. <br \/><br \/>Partnering with microcredit pioneer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grameen-info.org\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">GrameenBank<\/a>, in 1997 Quadir established <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grameenphone.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">GrameenPhone<\/a>, a wireless operator now offering phone services to 80 million rural Bangladeshi. It&#39;s become the model for <strong>a bottom-up, tech-empowered approach to development.<\/strong> &quot;Phones have a triple impact,&quot; Quadir says. &quot;They provide business opportunities; connect the village to the world; and generate over time a culture of entrepreneurship, which is crucial for any economic development.&quot;<\/p>","slug":"iqbal_quadir","published_at":"2007-03-03 13:19:00","updated_at":"2008-12-12 13:07:54"}}
