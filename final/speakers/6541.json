She has broadcast the sounds of a melting glacier, mapped all the dead stars, compiled a slide archive of darkness from the depths of the universe, created a light bulb to simulate the experience of moonlight and sent a recast meteorite back into space. Her works use sophisticated technologies and specialist expertise to stage intimate, poetic and philosophical engagements between people and their natural environment, collapsing the distance between the viewer and the most distant edges of time and the cosmos.<\/p><p>Paterson has exhibited internationally and her works have been included in major exhibitions at galleries including the Hayward Gallery, Tate Britain, MCA Sydney, Guggenheim Museum and The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. She was winner of the visual arts category of the South Bank Awards in 2014 and is an honorary fellow of Edinburgh University.<\/p><p>(Photo: James Bennet, 2021)<\/p>","slug":"katie_paterson","published_at":"2021-09-29 14:43:00","updated_at":"2022-01-28 15:18:47"}}
