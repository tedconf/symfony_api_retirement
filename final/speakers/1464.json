To end the global housing and climate crises, we need to get past innovation-stifling regulations and well-meaning but misguided ideas popularized by mainstream media. His proposal: Forget steel, straw, concrete, shipping containers, and rammed earth. Use wood to erect urban skyscrapers. &ldquo;When the Eiffel Tower was built, nobody thought it could be done. Now it&rsquo;s a symbol of Paris,&rdquo; Green told the <em>Vancouver Sun<\/em>. &ldquo;Projects like it really triggered an innovation on how cities were built. Man moves by innovation and [by] aiming for the moon.&rdquo;<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>Green, whose projects range from retail boutiques and housing in North America to a sustainable community in Asia, explores the plausibility of tall wood buildings -- the costs, benefits, and engineering challenges -- in an extensive 2012 white paper. The TED Talent Search winner also teaches and mentors at the University of British Columbia&rsquo;s School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (SALA).","slug":"michael_green","published_at":"2013-01-06 02:58:00","updated_at":"2014-11-11 15:51:54"}}
