He currently has his sights set on sequencing the genome of the woolly mammoth -- and cloning it.","whylisten":"<p>As a child Hendrik Poinar never imagined that the insects his father kept around the house, extinct and preserved in amber, could someday be brought to life. Well that&#39;s exactly what Poinar has devoted his career to doing. Today he is a molecular evolutionary geneticist and biological anthropologist at McMaster University in Ontario, where he is the principal investigator at the <a href=\"http:\/\/socserv.mcmaster.ca\/adna\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ancient DNA Centre<\/a>. Poinar&#39;s focus is on extracting and preserving DNA from paleontological remains -- precisely what he thought impossible as a kid.<\/p><p>And Poinar&#39;s newest project is much, much bigger than those insects from his childhood: He wants to bring back the woolly mammoth. In 2006 he and his team started working on sequencing the mammoth genome, based on DNA extracted from well-preserved remains found in Yukon and Siberia. With the mapping nearly complete, Poinar will next turn to engineering an animal very closely resembling the woolly mammoth.<\/p>","slug":"hendrik","published_at":"2013-05-29 21:37:00","updated_at":"2013-05-30 15:04:57"}}
