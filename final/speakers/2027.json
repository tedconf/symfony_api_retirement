His art is about the expression of the classical Indian dance forms Kathak and Bharat Nagyam, full of mythology, and their juxtaposition with the modern age. <br \/><br \/>He formed Aakash Odedra Company in 2011 to develop his own choreographic work. His debut project,&nbsp;<em>Rising<\/em> (2011), has won numerous international awards. Through 2013\/2014 he worked with Australian choreographer Lewis Major and Austrian based Ars Electronica Futurelab in an exploration of warped and exaggerated realities. They created <em>Murmur<\/em>, which uses ancient dance and media technology to tell of Aakash&#39;s own struggles with dyslexia.","slug":"aakash_odedra","published_at":"2014-08-12 20:04:00","updated_at":"2014-12-05 15:52:43"}}
