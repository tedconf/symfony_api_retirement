Along with his dad, Ron Sears, he&#39;s got <strong>a pretty neat father-son project<\/strong> going on: the Orb. <\/p><p>It&#39;s inspired by Buckminster Fuller&#39;s 1962 proposal for the Geoscope, which called for &quot;a 200-foot-diameter sphere covered with 10 million computer-controlled light sources to be suspended over the East River in full view of the United Nations.&quot; But <strong>by making the sphere spin, the Sears realized, they could use persistence of vision and LEDs<\/strong> to create a bright display with a three-dimensional effect using far fewer light sources.<\/p><p>Sears is now a student in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. He and his father presented the Orb version 2 at Coachella in 2008 and continue to tinker with it.<\/p>","slug":"nick_sears_1","published_at":"2008-12-05 01:00:00","updated_at":"2008-12-05 08:14:15"}}
