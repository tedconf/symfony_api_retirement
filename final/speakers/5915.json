She was nominated for a Grammy for her debut LP, self-released a follow-up album that included the smash hit &quot;Distance&quot; and has completed several world tours and TV appearances.&nbsp;She has also toured supporting artists such as the Alabama Shakes, Sara Bareilles, Maroon 5 and John Legend.<\/p><p>King grew up in a household dominated by music. The daughter of a singing jazz duo and sister to a multi-talented musician, she learned the trade at home, forgoing formal training, and often accompanied her parents on tour. She still holds onto her jazz and urban roots while challenging herself to tap into new reserves of self confidence, challenges and adventures.<\/p>","slug":"emily_king","published_at":"2020-03-03 14:54:00","updated_at":"2020-09-11 16:06:20"}}
