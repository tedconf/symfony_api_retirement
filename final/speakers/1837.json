Since she began reporting in 2006, the Saudi-born TED Fellow has shifted her focus from the Israeli\/Palestinian conflict to women&#39;s issues in the Gaza Strip. As one of the few female photojournalists based in the region, Mohammed regularly faces discrimination, sexual harassment and open spite for what&#39;s seen as her audacity to join a men&#39;s field. Mohammed believes this can change for future generations of Gazan women. She says of raising her daughters, &quot;Everything comes with a reason. They have the right to ask questions and do with whatever they wish or like, as long as it&rsquo;s not hurting them or others.&quot;","slug":"eman_mohammed","published_at":"2014-03-17 21:12:00","updated_at":"2021-09-23 21:17:59"}}
