Some of the questions that intrigue them: If a parasite depends on its host&#39;s survival for its own well-being, why do so many of them cause harm? In what ways are hosts able to self-medicate in order to make themselves less desirable to parasites? And are the abilities to harm hosts &mdash; and the ability of hosts to self-medicate &mdash; favored by natural selection?<\/p> <p>The De Roode Lab focuses on the monarch butterfly and its parasites. The team has made a fascinating discovery: that female butterflies infected by a parasite choose to lay their eggs on a specific variety of milkweed that helps their offspring avoid getting sick. De Roode hopes that this insight could lead to new approaches in medications for human beings in the future.<\/p>","slug":"jaap_de_roode","published_at":"2014-11-12 19:46:00","updated_at":"2015-02-10 16:00:46"}}
