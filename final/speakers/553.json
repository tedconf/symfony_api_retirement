The school now enrolls almost 300 children and has franchised its curriculum widely. <\/p><p><strong>Sethi&#39;s latest project, inspired by dialogue with the children of Riverside, is called AProCh -- which stands for &quot;A Protagonist in every Child.&quot;<\/strong> Fighting the stereotype of modern kids as rude and delinquent, AProCh looks for ways to engage Ahmedabad&#39;s children in modern city life, and to revamp our cities to make room for kids to learn, both actively and by example.<\/p>","slug":"kiran_sethi","published_at":"2009-10-06 12:00:00","updated_at":"2010-01-12 08:46:48"}}
