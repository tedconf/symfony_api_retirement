Marishane&#39;s friend turned to him and said, &quot;Man, why doesn&#39;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don&#39;t have to bathe?&quot; Marishane, 17 at the time, thought: Yeah, why not? It took six months of research to develop a formula for a lotion that cleanses cheaply and easily -- especially important for the 2.5 billion people worldwide who lack proper access to water and sanitation.  <\/p><p> DryBath has the same effect as anti-bacterial cleanser, but it&#39;s odorless and creates a biodegradable film that cleanes and moisturizes the skin. Five years later, it&#39;s now available on the market. Marishane has since enrolled at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and was named the Global Student Entrepreneur of the Year in 2011.<\/p>","slug":"ludwick_marishane","published_at":"2012-12-03 22:21:00","updated_at":"2012-12-04 16:06:37"}}
