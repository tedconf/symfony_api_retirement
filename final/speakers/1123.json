Their first collaborative effort yielded a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; probe that makes tumors margins fluoresce, or &ldquo;glow&rdquo; and thus easier for surgeons to see and remove accurately during surgery. Their most recent joint effort resulted in another type of probe that can make nerves &ldquo;glow&rdquo; during surgery, thus helping surgeons repair injured nerves and avoid inadvertent injury.<\/p><p>She is a professor of surgery&nbsp;and director of the Facial Nerve Clinic at the University of California, San Diego.<\/p>","slug":"quyen_nguyen","published_at":"2011-12-13 15:56:00","updated_at":"2011-12-13 15:57:05"}}
