The twist: Santos looks not only for positive humanlike traits, like tool-using and altruism, but irrational ones, like biased decisionmaking.<\/p><p>In elegant, carefully constructed experiments, Santos and CapLab have studied <strong>how primates understand and categorize objects in the physical world<\/strong> -- for instance, that monkeys understand an object is still whole even when part of it is obscured. Going deeper, their experiments also search for clues that primates possess a theory of mind -- an ability to think about what other people think. <\/p><p>Most recently, the lab has been looking at behaviors that were once the province mainly of novelists: jealousy, frustration, judgment of others&#39; intentions, poor economic choices. In one experiment, Santos and her team <strong>taught monkeys to use a form of money<\/strong>, tradeable for food. When certain foods became cheaper, monkeys would, like humans, overbuy. As we humans search for clues to our own irrational behaviors, Santos&#39; research suggests that the source of our genius for bad decisions might be our monkey brains.<\/p>","slug":"laurie_santos","published_at":"2010-06-09 07:34:00","updated_at":"2010-07-29 09:39:23"}}
