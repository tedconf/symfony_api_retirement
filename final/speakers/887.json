","whylisten":"<p>Carlo Ratti is a civil engineer and architect who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he directs the SENSEable City Laboratory. This lab studies the built environment of cities -- from street grids to plumbing and garbage systems -- using new kinds of sensors and hand-held electronics that have transformed the way we can describe and understand cities.<\/p><p>Other projects flip this equation -- using data gathered from sensors to actually create dazzling new environments. The Digital Water Pavilion, for instance, reacts to visitors by parting a stream of water to let them visit. And a project for the 2012 Olympics in London turns a pavilion building into a cloud of blinking interactive art. He&#39;s opening a research center in Singapore as part of an MIT-led initiative on the Future of Urban Mobility. <\/p><p>For more information on the projects in this talk, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/senseable.mit.edu\/ted2011\/\" target=\"_blank\">SENSEable @ TED &gt;&gt;<\/a>  <\/p>","slug":"carlo_ratti","published_at":"2010-12-18 20:17:00","updated_at":"2015-09-10 00:21:39"}}
