He believes the end of the fossil fuels era will soon force a return to smaller-scale, agrarian communities -- and an overhaul of the most destructive features of postwar society.","whylisten":"<p>James Howard Kunstler calls suburban sprawl &quot;<strong>the greatest misallocation of resources the world has ever known<\/strong>.&quot; His arguments bring a new lens to urban development, drawing clear connections between physical spaces and cultural vitality.<br \/><br \/><em><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/geoofnowhere\" target=\"_blank\">Geography of Nowhere<\/a>,<\/em> published in 1993, presented a grim vision of America in decline -- <strong>a nation of cookie-cutter strip malls, vacuous city centers, and dead spaces<\/strong> wrought by what Kunstler calls the ethos of Happy Motoring: our society-wide dependence on the automobile. <br \/><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/geni.us\/longemergency\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Long Emergency<\/em><\/a>  (2005) takes a hard look at energy dependency, <strong>arguing that the end of the fossil fuels era will force a return to smaller-scale, agrarian-focused communities<\/strong> and an overhaul of many of the most prominent and destructive features of postwar society. <br \/><br \/>His confrontational approach and propensity for doomsday scenarios make Kunstler<strong> a lightning rod for controversy and critics<\/strong>. But his magnificent rants are underscored with logic and his books are widely read, particularly by architectural critics and urban planners.<\/p>","slug":"james_howard_kunstler","published_at":"2007-04-09 22:50:00","updated_at":"2015-07-10 20:06:12"}}
