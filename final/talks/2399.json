{"talk":{"id":2399,"name":"Robert Waldinger: What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness","description":"What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone \u2013 but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction.

life.","slug":"robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness","recorded_at":"2015-11-14 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-12-23 16:57:21","updated_at":"2021-04-13
