{"talk":{"id":1990,"name":"Mellody Hobson: Color blind or color brave?","description":"The subject of race can be very touchy.  As finance executive Mellody Hobson says, it's a \"conversational third rail.\" But, she says, that's exactly why we need to start talking about it. In this engaging, persuasive talk, Hobson makes the case that speaking openly about race \u2014 and particularly about diversity in hiring -- makes for better businesses and a better society.","slug":"mellody_hobson_color_blind_or_color_brave","recorded_at":"2014-03-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-05-05 16:24:50","updated_at":"2021-04-13
