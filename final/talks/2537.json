{"talk":{"id":2537,"name":"Julia Galef: Why you think you're right -- even if you're wrong","description":"Perspective is everything, especially when it comes to examining your beliefs. Are you a soldier, prone to defending your viewpoint at all costs -- or a scout, spurred by curiosity? Julia Galef examines the motivations behind these two mindsets and how they shape the way we interpret information, interweaved with a compelling history lesson from 19th-century France. When your steadfast opinions are tested, Galef asks: \"What do you most yearn for? Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?\"","slug":"julia_galef_why_you_think_you_re_right_even_if_you_re_wrong","recorded_at":"2016-02-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-06-29 15:31:08","updated_at":"2021-04-13
