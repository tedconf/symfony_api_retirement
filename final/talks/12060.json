{"talk":{"id":12060,"name":"Eve Abrams: The human stories behind mass incarceration","description":"The United States locks up more people than any other country in the world, says documentarian Eve Abrams, and somewhere between one and four percent of those in prison are likely innocent. That's 87,000 brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers -- predominantly African American -- unnecessarily separated from their families, their lives and dreams put on hold. Using audio from her interviews with incarcerated people and their families, Abrams shares touching stories of those impacted by mass incarceration and calls on us all to take a stand and ensure that the justice system works for everyone.","slug":"eve_abrams_the_human_stories_behind_mass_incarceration","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-22 20:00:55","updated_at":"2021-10-22 20:42:03","viewed_count":922446,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":471,"name":"TEDWomen 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/45cf319f4af4d3bdec2620ab2e48cb3f23100774_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/45cf319f4af4d3bdec2620ab2e48cb3f23100774_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/45cf319f4af4d3bdec2620ab2e48cb3f23100774_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/45cf319f4af4d3bdec2620ab2e48cb3f23100774_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/384f3f30ccd18ce7fbdda0512fbdddf9e83f89ec_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6770659,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18710174,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33135243,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46673773,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62442536,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98000861,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":151762422,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6984828,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46839678,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98137329,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8246906,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18965704,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EveAbrams_2017W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98139461,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"family"},{"tag":"justice system"},{"tag":"law"},{"tag":"prison"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3609,"name":"Eve Abrams"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":68}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":24}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":2}}]}}
