{"talk":{"id":1683,"name":"Allan Savory: How to fight desertification and reverse climate change","description":"(NOTE: Statements in this talk have been challenged by scientists working in this field. Please read \"Criticisms & Updates\" below for more details.) \"Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,\" begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work may show -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.","slug":"allan_savory_how_to_fight_desertification_and_reverse_climate_change","recorded_at":"2013-02-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-03-04 15:51:11","updated_at":"2021-04-09
