{"talk":{"id":1827,"name":"Stuart Firestein: The pursuit of ignorance","description":"What does real scientific work look like? As neuroscientist Stuart Firestein jokes: It looks a lot less like the scientific method and a lot more like \"farting around ... in the dark.\" In this witty talk, Firestein gets to the heart of

know.","slug":"stuart_firestein_the_pursuit_of_ignorance","recorded_at":"2013-02-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-09-24 15:03:56","updated_at":"2021-04-09
