{"talk":{"id":10550,"name":"Jason Shen: Looking for a job? Highlight your ability, not your experience","description":"Very few of us hold jobs that line up directly with our past experiences or what we studied in college. Take TED Resident Jason Shen; he studied biology but later became a product manager at a tech company. In this quick, insightful talk about human potential, Shen shares some new thinking on how job seekers can make themselves more attractive -- and why employers should look for ability over credentials.","slug":"jason_shen_looking_for_a_job_highlight_your_ability_not_your_experience","recorded_at":"2017-11-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-02-20 21:00:19","updated_at":"2020-09-28
