{"talk":{"id":2616,"name":"Kandice Sumner: How America's public schools keep kids in poverty","description":"Why should a good education be exclusive to rich kids? Schools in low-income neighborhoods across the US, specifically in communities of color, lack resources that are standard at wealthier schools -- things like musical instruments, new books, healthy school lunches and soccer fields -- and this has a real impact on the potential of students. Kandice Sumner sees the disparity every day in her classroom in Boston. In this inspiring talk, she asks us to face facts -- and change them.","slug":"kandice_sumner_how_america_s_public_schools_keep_kids_in_poverty","recorded_at":"2015-11-14
