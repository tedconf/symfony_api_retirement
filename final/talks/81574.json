{"talk":{"id":81574,"name":"Jenna C. Lester: The first step towards more inclusive dermatology","description":"Skin is one of the most powerful predictors of health, yet nearly half of all new dermatologists admit to feeling uncomfortable identifying health issues on darker skin tones -- resulting in poorer health outcomes for patients of color. In this crucial talk, TED Fellow and dermatologist Jenna C. Lester shares her effort to extend medical training beyond its current limited scope and ensure all medical students get trained in the full spectrum of diseases as they appear in all patients, regardless of skin tone.","slug":"jenna_c_lester_the_first_step_towards_more_inclusive_dermatology","recorded_at":"2021-08-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-10-14 14:49:05","updated_at":"2021-10-21 16:09:28","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":724,"name":"TEDMonterey"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6842ceceb565d79d853d897b72d8cef63a16763b_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6842ceceb565d79d853d897b72d8cef63a16763b_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6842ceceb565d79d853d897b72d8cef63a16763b_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6842ceceb565d79d853d897b72d8cef63a16763b_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ef8649a95ce77a7efe2ea77515470af4d6cb155a_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":2834370,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7785897,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13819060,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19569817,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26348878,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41120834,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62995577,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3048651,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19735748,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41257362,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JennaCLester_2021.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3641770,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"languages":{"en":{"name":"English","native":true}},"tags":[{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"health care"},{"tag":"medical research"},{"tag":"race"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6384,"name":"Jenna C.
