{"talk":{"id":8947,"name":"Cleo Wade: Want to change the world? Start by being brave enough to care","description":"Artist and poet Cleo Wade recites a moving poem about being an advocate for love and acceptance in a time when both seem in short supply. Woven between stories of people at the beginning and end of their lives, she shares some truths about growing up (and speaking up) and reflects on the wisdom of a life well-lived, leaving us with a simple yet enduring takeaway: be good to yourself, be good to others, be good to the earth. \"The world will say to you, 'Be a better person,'\" Wade says. \"Do not be afraid to say, 'Yes.'\"","slug":"cleo_wade_want_to_change_the_world_start_by_being_brave_enough_to_care","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-19 15:52:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13
