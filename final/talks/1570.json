{"talk":{"id":1570,"name":"Shimon Schocken: The self-organizing computer course","description":"Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan developed a curriculum for their students to build a computer, piece by piece. When they put the course online -- giving away the tools, simulators, chip specifications and other building blocks -- they were surprised that thousands jumped at the opportunity to learn, working independently as well as organizing their own classes in the first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). A call to forget about grades and tap into the self-motivation to learn.","slug":"shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course","recorded_at":"2012-06-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-10-04
