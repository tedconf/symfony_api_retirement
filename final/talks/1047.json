{"talk":{"id":1047,"name":"Deborah Rhodes: A test that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it's not available to you","description":"Working with a team of physicists, Dr. Deborah Rhodes developed a new tool for tumor detection that's 3 times as effective as traditional mammograms for women with dense breast tissue. The life-saving implications are stunning. So why haven't we heard of it? Rhodes shares the story behind the tool's creation, and the web of politics and economics that keep it from mainstream use.","slug":"deborah_rhodes_a_test_that_finds_3x_more_breast_tumors_and_why_it_s_not_available_to_you","recorded_at":"2010-12-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-01-06
