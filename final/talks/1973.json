{"talk":{"id":1973,"name":"David Brooks: Should you live for your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ... or your eulogy?","description":"Within each of us are two selves, suggests David Brooks in this meditative short talk: the self who craves success, who builds a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and the self who seeks connection, community, love -- the values that make for a great eulogy. (Joseph Soloveitchik has called these selves \"Adam I\" and \"Adam II.\") Brooks asks: Can we balance these two selves?","slug":"david_brooks_should_you_live_for_your_resume_or_your_eulogy","recorded_at":"2014-03-19 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-04-14 15:09:06","updated_at":"2021-04-13
