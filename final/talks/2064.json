{"talk":{"id":2064,"name":"Aziza Chaouni: How I brought a river, and my city, back to life","description":"The Fez River winds through the medina of Fez, Morocco\u2014a mazelike medieval city that's a World Heritage site. Once considered the \"soul\" of this celebrated city, the river succumbed to sewage and pollution, and in the 1950s was covered over bit by bit until nothing remained.

process.","slug":"aziza_chaouni_how_i_brought_a_river_and_my_city_back_to_life","recorded_at":"2014-03-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-08-19 14:56:48","updated_at":"2020-10-05
