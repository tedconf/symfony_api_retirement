{"talk":{"id":12571,"name":"Drew Philp: My $500 house in Detroit -- and the neighbors who helped me rebuild it","description":"In 2009, journalist and screenwriter Drew Philp bought a ruined house in Detroit for $500. In the years that followed, as he gutted the interior and removed the heaps of garbage crowding the rooms, he didn't just learn how to repair a house -- he learned how to build a community. In a tribute to the city he loves, Philp tells us about \"radical neighborliness\" and makes the case that we have \"the power to create the world anew together and to do it ourselves when our governments refuse.\"","slug":"drew_philp_my_500_house_in_detroit_and_the_neighbors_who_helped_me_rebuild_it","recorded_at":"2017-11-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-03 20:00:55","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:40:19","viewed_count":1290191,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":429,"name":"TEDNYC"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b23f8fec537419244f841c0f90b31c596a299543_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b23f8fec537419244f841c0f90b31c596a299543_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b23f8fec537419244f841c0f90b31c596a299543_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b23f8fec537419244f841c0f90b31c596a299543_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1ee364582e6e8cef834b3687db9e4a8da817bef5_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6781083,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18802136,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33245719,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46750798,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62382226,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98641443,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":152490026,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7040024,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47270009,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98900128,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8343820,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19056451,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DrewPhilp_2017S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98889642,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"United States"},{"tag":"cities"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"infrastructure"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3763,"name":"Drew Philp"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":13}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":55}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":77}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":117}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":57}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":3}}]}}
