{"talk":{"id":2231,"name":"Barat Ali Batoor: My desperate journey with a human smuggler","description":"Photojournalist Barat Ali Batoor was living in Afghanistan -- until his risky work forced him to leave the country. But for Batoor, a member of a displaced ethnic group called the Hazara, moving home to Pakistan proved dangerous too. And finding a safer place wasn't as simple as buying a plane ticket. Instead, he was forced to pay a human smuggler, and join the deadly tidal wave of migrants seeking asylum by boat. He documents the harrowing ocean trip with powerful photographs.","slug":"barat_ali_batoor_my_desperate_journey_with_a_human_smuggler","recorded_at":"2014-04-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-04-10
