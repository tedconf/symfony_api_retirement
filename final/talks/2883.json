{"talk":{"id":2883,"name":"Helen Pearson: Lessons from the longest study on human development","description":"For the past 70 years, scientists in Britain have been studying thousands of children through their lives to find out why some end up happy and healthy while others struggle. It's the longest-running study of human development in the world, and it's produced some of the best-studied people on the planet while changing the way we live, learn and parent.
