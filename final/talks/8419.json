{"talk":{"id":8419,"name":"Lisa Feldman Barrett: You aren't at the mercy of your emotions -- your brain creates them","description":"Can you look at someone's face and know what they're feeling? Does everyone experience happiness, sadness and anxiety the same way? What are emotions anyway? For the past 25 years, psychology professor Lisa Feldman Barrett has mapped facial expressions, scanned brains and analyzed hundreds of physiology studies to understand what emotions really are. She shares the results of her exhaustive research -- and explains how we may have more control over our emotions than we think.","slug":"lisa_feldman_barrett_you_aren_t_at_the_mercy_of_your_emotions_your_brain_creates_them","recorded_at":"2017-12-06 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-02 21:00:25","updated_at":"2021-04-13
