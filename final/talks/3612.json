{"talk":{"id":3612,"name":"Victoria Pratt: How judges can show respect","description":"In halls of justice around the world, how can we ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect? A pioneering judge in New Jersey, Victoria Pratt shares her principles of \"procedural justice\" -- four simple, thoughtful steps that redefined the everyday business of her courtroom in Newark,
