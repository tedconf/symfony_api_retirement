Ghartey-Tagoe Kootin offers a sneak peek of her forthcoming musical \"At Buffalo.\" Drawing on archival material from the 1901 Pan-American Exhibition, a world's fair held in Buffalo, New York, the show examines conflicting representations of Black identity exhibited at the fair -- highlighting unsettlingly familiar parallels between American society at the turn of the century and today, and asking: Are we all still part of the show?","slug":"amma_y_ghartey_tagoe_kootin_a_historical_musical_that_examines_black_identity_in_the_1901_world_s_fair","recorded_at":"2019-04-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-11-08 16:03:09","updated_at":"2021-07-21 19:30:19","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":597,"name":"TED2019"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bde16b928a37c73ab8f4be5f2828e75f12a57d11_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bde16b928a37c73ab8f4be5f2828e75f12a57d11_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bde16b928a37c73ab8f4be5f2828e75f12a57d11_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bde16b928a37c73ab8f4be5f2828e75f12a57d11_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/262c05f3a69d4edfad7918218a2b87c9340bf006_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5277604,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14625072,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25909055,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36527441,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48937094,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76709881,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":118547291,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5491814,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36693337,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76846176,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6534863,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14873023,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AmmaYGharteyTagoeKootin_2019U-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76841174,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"gu":{"name":"Gujarati"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"United States"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"music"},{"tag":"performance"},{"tag":"race"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5194,"name":"Amma Y.
