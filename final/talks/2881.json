It doesn't, says Olu\u0301fe\u0301\u0323mi Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300 -- it has a knowledge crisis. Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300 suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity.","slug":"oluf_mi_taiwo_why_africa_must_become_a_center_of_knowledge_again","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-09-19 15:06:53","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:44:34","viewed_count":1117013,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":465,"name":"TEDGlobal 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c358c44d0e7fd4c32b18d436ce71f9c5a96afbf4_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c358c44d0e7fd4c32b18d436ce71f9c5a96afbf4_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c358c44d0e7fd4c32b18d436ce71f9c5a96afbf4_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c358c44d0e7fd4c32b18d436ce71f9c5a96afbf4_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9c8e0c8812ce001988296241e8ca922893c8a35d_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6708016,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18536757,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32861171,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46269916,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":61866075,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":96959309,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":150167270,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6973054,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46626015,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":97520127,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18802240,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":97521079,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"ka":{"name":"Georgian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Africa"},{"tag":"agriculture"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"library"},{"tag":"philosophy"},{"tag":"resources"},{"tag":"rivers"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"water"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3539,"name":"Olu\u0301fe\u0301\u0323mi Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":27}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":84}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":66}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":80}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":32}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":31}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":3}}]}}
