{"talk":{"id":2483,"name":"Aditi Gupta: A taboo-free way to talk about periods","description":"It's true: talking about menstruation makes many people uncomfortable. And that taboo has consequences: in India, three out of every 10 girls don't even know what menstruation is at the time of their first period, and restrictive customs related to periods inflict psychological damage on young girls. Growing up with this taboo herself, Aditi Gupta knew she wanted to help girls, parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably and without shame. She shares how she did it.","slug":"aditi_gupta_a_taboo_free_way_to_talk_about_periods","recorded_at":"2015-05-29 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-04-21 15:00:16","updated_at":"2021-04-09
