{"talk":{"id":1894,"name":"Andrew Solomon: Depression, the secret we share","description":"\"The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment.\" In a talk equal parts eloquent and devastating, writer Andrew Solomon takes you to the darkest corners of his mind during the years he battled depression. That led him to an eye-opening journey across the world to interview others with depression -- only to discover that, to his surprise, the more he talked, the more people wanted to tell their own stories.","slug":"andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share","recorded_at":"2013-10-23 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-12-18 16:01:49","updated_at":"2020-09-28
