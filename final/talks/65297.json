{"talk":{"id":65297,"name":"Yann LeCun: Deep learning, neural networks and the future of AI","description":"Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Facebook, helped develop the deep learning algorithms that power many artificial intelligence systems today. In conversation with head of TED Chris Anderson, LeCun discusses his current research into self-supervised machine learning, how he's trying to build machines that learn with common sense (like humans) and his hopes for the next conceptual breakthrough in AI.","slug":"yann_lecun_deep_learning_neural_networks_and_the_future_of_ai","recorded_at":"2020-06-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-07-22 19:49:24","updated_at":"2020-10-16 19:55:59","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/38446b383580d2159018eabb696809ea41da32f6_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/38446b383580d2159018eabb696809ea41da32f6_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/38446b383580d2159018eabb696809ea41da32f6_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/38446b383580d2159018eabb696809ea41da32f6_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/677035e117abd6cb3cfaa3aa5b244189dd8bbcdf_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":27116993,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":75559948,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":133529637,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":187462680,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":249684390,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":382080761,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":598524740,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":27375142,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":187981933,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/YannLeCun_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":382357513,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"tags":[{"tag":"AI"},{"tag":"algorithm"},{"tag":"computers"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"machine learning"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5897,"name":"Yann LeCun"}},{"speaker":{"id":187,"name":"Chris Anderson"}}],"ratings":[]}}
