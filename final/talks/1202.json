{"talk":{"id":1202,"name":"Harald Haas: Wireless data from every light bulb","description":"What if every light bulb in the world could also transmit data? At TEDGlobal, Harald Haas demonstrates, for the first time, a device that could do exactly that. By flickering the light from a single LED, a change too quick for the human eye to detect, he can transmit far more data than a cellular tower -- and do it in a way that's more efficient, secure and widespread.","slug":"harald_haas_wireless_data_from_every_light_bulb","recorded_at":"2011-07-13 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-08-02 14:08:49","updated_at":"2020-09-28
