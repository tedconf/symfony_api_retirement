{"talk":{"id":2872,"name":"Mei Lin Neo: The fascinating secret lives of giant clams","description":"When you think about the deep blue sea, you might instantly think of whales or coral reefs. But spare a thought for giant clams, the world's largest living shellfish. These incredible creatures can live to 100, grow up to four and a half feet long and weigh as much as three baby elephants. In this charming talk, marine biologist Mei Lin Neo shares why she's obsessively trying to turn these legendary sea creatures into heroes of the oceans.","slug":"mei_lin_neo_the_fascinating_secret_lives_of_giant_clams","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-09-26 14:55:15","updated_at":"2021-04-09
