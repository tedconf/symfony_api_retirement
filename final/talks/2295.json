{"talk":{"id":2295,"name":"Memory Banda: A warrior\u2019s cry against child marriage","description":"Memory Banda\u2019s life took a divergent path from her sister\u2019s. When her sister reached puberty, she was sent to a traditional \u201cinitiation camp\u201d that teaches girls \u201chow to sexually please a man.\u201d She got pregnant there \u2014 at age 11. Banda, however, refused to go. Instead, she organized others and asked her community\u2019s leader to issue a bylaw that no girl should be forced to marry before turning 18. She pushed on to the national level \u2026 with incredible results for girls across Malawi.","slug":"memory_banda_a_warrior_s_cry_against_child_marriage","recorded_at":"2015-05-29
