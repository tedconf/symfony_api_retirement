This money, known as remittances, makes a significant difference in the lives of those receiving it and plays a major role in the economies of many countries.

obstacles.","slug":"dilip_ratha_the_hidden_force_in_global_economics_sending_money_home","recorded_at":"2014-10-07 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-10-09 15:03:37","updated_at":"2021-04-13
