{"talk":{"id":1773,"name":"Margaret Heffernan: The dangers of willful blindness","description":"Gayla Benefield was just doing her job -- until she uncovered an awful secret about her hometown that meant its mortality rate was 80 times higher than anywhere else in the US. But when she tried to tell people about it, she learned an even more shocking truth: People didn't want to know. In a talk that's part history lesson, part call-to-action, Margaret Heffernan demonstrates the danger of willful blindness, and praises ordinary people like Benefield who are willing to speak up.","slug":"margaret_heffernan_the_dangers_of_willful_blindness","recorded_at":"2013-03-22 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-08-12 14:58:32","updated_at":"2021-04-13
