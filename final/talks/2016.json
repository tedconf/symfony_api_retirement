{"talk":{"id":2016,"name":"Yoruba Richen: What the gay rights movement learned from the civil rights movement","description":"As a member of both the African American and LGBT communities, filmmaker Yoruba Richen is fascinated with the overlaps and tensions between the gay rights and the civil rights movements. She explores how the two struggles intertwine and propel each other forward \u2014 and, in an unmissable argument, she dispels a myth about their points of conflict.
