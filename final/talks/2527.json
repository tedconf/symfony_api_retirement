{"talk":{"id":2527,"name":"Chris Milk: The birth of virtual reality as an art form","description":"Chris Milk uses innovative technologies to make personal, interactive, human stories. Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano, Milk traces his relationship to music and art -- from the first moment he remembers putting on headphones to his current work creating breakthrough virtual reality projects. VR is the last medium for storytelling, he says, because it closes the gap between audience and storyteller. To illustrate, he brought the TED audience together in the world's largest collective VR experience. Join them and take part in this interactive talk by getting a Google Cardboard and downloading the experience at with.in\/TED.","slug":"chris_milk_the_birth_of_virtual_reality_as_an_art_form","recorded_at":"2016-02-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-06-16 20:00:55","updated_at":"2021-04-09 18:55:45","viewed_count":878187,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":377,"name":"TED2016"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/13619efc51739f5da9820b628f075427d4fe7cdd_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/13619efc51739f5da9820b628f075427d4fe7cdd_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/13619efc51739f5da9820b628f075427d4fe7cdd_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/13619efc51739f5da9820b628f075427d4fe7cdd_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7ca6f48c5632ebd7bb4442b772ce7eb173731648_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8683422,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24063345,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42605318,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":59965042,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":80148454,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":125901549,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":195405497,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8816865,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":60080252,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":125893577,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10580418,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24315678,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisMilk_2016-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":125888394,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"art"},{"tag":"beauty"},{"tag":"collaboration"},{"tag":"communication"},{"tag":"entertainment"},{"tag":"film"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"media"},{"tag":"technology"},{"tag":"virtual reality"},{"tag":"visualizations"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2504,"name":"Chris Milk"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":283}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":220}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":206}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":130}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":94}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":30}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":41}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":3}}]}}
