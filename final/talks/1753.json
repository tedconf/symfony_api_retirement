{"talk":{"id":1753,"name":"Jackson Katz: Violence against women -- it's a men's issue","description":"Domestic violence and sexual abuse are often called \"women's issues.\" But in this bold, blunt talk, Jackson Katz points out that these are intrinsically men's issues -- and shows how these violent behaviors are tied to definitions of manhood. A clarion call for us all -- women and men -- to call out unacceptable behavior and be leaders of change.","slug":"jackson_katz_violence_against_women_it_s_a_men_s_issue","recorded_at":"2012-11-30
