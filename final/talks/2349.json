{"talk":{"id":2349,"name":"Alyson McGregor: Why medicine often has dangerous side effects for women","description":"You might not know this: Many of the medicines we take -- common drugs like Ambien and everyday aspirin -- were only ever tested on men. And the unknown side effects for women can be dangerous, even deadly.
