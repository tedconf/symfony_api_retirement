{"talk":{"id":2800,"name":"Sharon Terry: Science didn't understand my kids' rare disease until I decided to study it","description":"Meet Sharon Terry, a former college chaplain and stay-at-home mom who took the medical research world by storm when her two young children were diagnosed with a rare disease known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).
