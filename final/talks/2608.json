{"talk":{"id":2608,"name":"Philippa Neave: The unexpected challenges of a country's first election","description":"How do you teach an entire country how to vote when no one has done it before? It's a huge challenge facing fledgling democracies around the world -- and one of the biggest problems turns out to be a lack of shared language.

gap.","slug":"philippa_neave_the_unexpected_challenges_of_a_country_s_first_election","recorded_at":"2016-09-07 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-10-21 15:10:17","updated_at":"2021-04-09
