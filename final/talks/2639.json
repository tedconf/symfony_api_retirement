{"talk":{"id":2639,"name":"Natalie Panek: Let's clean up the space junk orbiting Earth","description":"Our lives depend on a world we can't see: the satellite infrastructure we use every day for information, entertainment, communication and so much more. But Earth orbit isn't a limitless resource, and the problem of space debris will get worse without a significant change to our behavior. Natalie Panek challenges us to consider the environmental impact of the satellites we rely on. Our orbital environment is breathtakingly beautiful and our gateway to exploration, she says. It's up to us to keep it that way.","slug":"natalie_panek_let_s_clean_up_the_space_junk_orbiting_earth","recorded_at":"2015-10-22 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-12-06
