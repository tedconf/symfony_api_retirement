{"talk":{"id":54754,"name":"Victoria Gill: What a nun can teach a scientist about ecology","description":"To save the achoque -- an exotic (and adorable) salamander found in a lake in northern Mexico -- scientists teamed up with an unexpected research partner: a group of nuns called the Sisters of the Immaculate Health. In this delightful talk, science journalist Victoria Gill shares the story of how this unusual collaboration saved the achoque from extinction -- and demonstrates how local and indigenous people could hold the secret to saving our planet's weird, wonderful and most threatened species.","slug":"victoria_gill_what_a_nun_can_teach_a_scientist_about_ecology","recorded_at":"2019-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-02-12 16:01:35","updated_at":"2021-10-22 23:16:16","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":617,"name":"TED@NAS"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8efcabd7aa3525cdb1c22d5f03a3784c30d5790_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8efcabd7aa3525cdb1c22d5f03a3784c30d5790_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8efcabd7aa3525cdb1c22d5f03a3784c30d5790_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8efcabd7aa3525cdb1c22d5f03a3784c30d5790_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/69179188856a1334b1176a9dddcd1cc869f9a297_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6914336,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19155183,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33920767,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47770227,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":63914961,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":100310679,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":157093737,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7128771,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47936063,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":100447322,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19414574,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VictoriaGill_2019S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":100442638,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ku":{"name":"Kurdish"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"animals"},{"tag":"biodiversity"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"collaboration"},{"tag":"conservation"},{"tag":"ecology"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"nature"},{"tag":"science"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5629,"name":"Victoria Gill"}}],"ratings":[]}}
