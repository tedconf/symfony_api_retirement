{"talk":{"id":2175,"name":"Khadija Gbla: My mother\u2019s strange definition of empowerment","description":"Khadija Gbla grew up caught between two definitions of what it means to be an \u201cempowered woman.\u201d While her Sierra Leonean mother thought that circumsizing her \u2014 and thus stifling her sexual urges \u2014 was the ultimate form of empowerment, her culture as a teenager in Australia told her that she deserved pleasure and that what happened to her was called \u201cfemale genital mutilation.\u201d In a candid and funny talk, she shares what it was like to make her way in a \u201cclitoris-centric society,\u201d and how she works to make sure other women don\u2019t have to figure this out.
