{"talk":{"id":1801,"name":"Julie Taymor: Spider-Man, The Lion King and life on the creative edge","description":"Showing spectacular clips from productions such as Frida, The Tempest and The Lion King, director Julie Taymor describes a life spent immersed in theater and the movies. Filmed right as controversy over her Broadway production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was at its peak, she candidly describes the tensions inherent within her creative process, as she strives both to capture the essence of a story--and produce images and experiences unlike anything else.","slug":"julie_taymor_spider_man_the_lion_king_and_life_on_the_creative_edge","recorded_at":"2011-03-02
