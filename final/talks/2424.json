{"talk":{"id":2424,"name":"Andr\u00e9s Ruzo: The boiling river of the Amazon","description":"When Andr\u00e9s Ruzo was a young boy in Peru, his grandfather told him a story with an odd detail: There is a river, deep in the Amazon, which boils as if a fire burns below it. Twelve years later, after training as a geoscientist, he set out on a journey deep into the jungle of South America in search of this boiling river. At a time when everything seems mapped and measured, join Ruzo as he explores a river that forces us to question the line between known and unknown ... and reminds us that there are great wonders yet to be discovered.","slug":"andres_ruzo_the_boiling_river_of_the_amazon","recorded_at":"2014-10-06 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-02-02 15:55:45","updated_at":"2021-04-09
