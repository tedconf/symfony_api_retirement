{"talk":{"id":3365,"name":"Christen Reighter: I don't want children -- stop telling me I'll change my mind","description":"One in five women in the United States will not have a biological child, and Christen Reighter is one of them. From a young age, she knew she didn't want kids, in spite of the insistence of many people (including her doctor) who told her she'd change her mind. In this powerful talk, she shares her story of seeking sterilization -- and makes the case that motherhood is an extension of womanhood, not the definition.","slug":"christen_reighter_i_don_t_want_children_stop_telling_me_i_ll_change_my_mind","recorded_at":"2016-10-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-11-16 21:00:29","updated_at":"2022-01-11
