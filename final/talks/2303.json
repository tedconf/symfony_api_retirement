{"talk":{"id":2303,"name":"Salvatore Iaconesi: What happened when I open-sourced my brain cancer","description":"When artist Salvatore Iaconesi was diagnosed with brain cancer, he refused to be a passive patient -- which, he points out, means \"one who waits.\" So he hacked his brain scans, posted them online, and invited a global community to pitch in on a \"cure.\" This sometimes meant medical advice, and it sometimes meant art, music, emotional support -- from more than half a million people.","slug":"salvatore_iaconesi_what_happened_when_i_open_sourced_my_brain_cancer","recorded_at":"2013-06-09 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-07-16 15:46:59","updated_at":"2021-04-09
