{"talk":{"id":2633,"name":"Joe Lassiter: We need nuclear power to solve climate change","description":"Joe Lassiter is a deep thinker and straight talker focused on developing clean, secure and carbon-neutral supplies of reliable, low-cost energy. His analysis of the world's energy realities puts a powerful lens on the stubbornly touchy issue of nuclear power, including new designs for plants that can compete economically with fossil fuels. We have the potential to make nuclear safer and cheaper than it's been in the past, Lassiter says. Now we have to make the choice to pursue it.","slug":"joe_lassiter_we_need_nuclear_power_to_solve_climate_change","recorded_at":"2016-06-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-11-28
