{"talk":{"id":3363,"name":"Anjan Sundaram: Why I risked my life to expose a government massacre","description":"A war zone can pass for a mostly peaceful place when no one is watching, says investigative journalist and TED Fellow Anjan Sundaram. In this short, incisive talk, he takes us inside the conflict in the Central African Republic, where he saw the methodical preparation for ethnic cleansing, and shares a lesson about why it's important to bear witness to other people's suffering. \"Ignored people in all our communities tell us something important about who we are,\" Sundaram says. \"A witness can become precious, and their gaze most necessary, when violence passes silently, unseen and unheard.\"","slug":"anjan_sundaram_why_i_risked_my_life_to_expose_a_government_massacre","recorded_at":"2017-04-24
