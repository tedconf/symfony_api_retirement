{"talk":{"id":12501,"name":"Vikram Sharma: How quantum physics can make encryption stronger","description":"As quantum computing matures, it's going to bring unimaginable increases in computational power along with it -- and the systems we use to protect our data (and our democratic processes) will become even more vulnerable. But there's still time to plan against the impending data apocalypse, says encryption expert Vikram Sharma. Learn more about how he's fighting quantum with quantum: designing security devices and programs that use the power of quantum physics to defend against the most sophisticated attacks.","slug":"vikram_sharma_how_quantum_physics_can_make_encryption_stronger","recorded_at":"2017-12-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-27 14:58:41","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:29:41","viewed_count":1113742,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":480,"name":"TED@Westpac"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5378ca1ee2a7446ae6afc573179f2ac69cb8c445_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5378ca1ee2a7446ae6afc573179f2ac69cb8c445_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5378ca1ee2a7446ae6afc573179f2ac69cb8c445_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5378ca1ee2a7446ae6afc573179f2ac69cb8c445_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2ed0c2f393c1e33cbfd3e6c4afb9a71610cf527c_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5882934,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16275327,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28862083,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40660607,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":54429860,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":85341167,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":131979884,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6148051,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41016632,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":85901901,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7217423,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16547694,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VikramSharma_2017S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":85908017,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"computers"},{"tag":"data"},{"tag":"encryption"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"invention"},{"tag":"physics"},{"tag":"quantum"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3806,"name":"Vikram Sharma"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":56}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":1}}]}}
