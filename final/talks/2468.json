{"talk":{"id":2468,"name":"Tabetha Boyajian: The most mysterious star in the universe","description":"Something massive, with roughly 1,000 times the area of Earth, is blocking the light coming from a distant star known as KIC 8462852, and nobody is quite sure what it is. As astronomer Tabetha Boyajian investigated this perplexing celestial object, a colleague suggested something unusual: Could it be an alien-built megastructure? Such an extraordinary idea would require extraordinary evidence. In this talk, Boyajian gives us a look at how scientists search for and test hypotheses when faced with the unknown.","slug":"tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe","recorded_at":"2016-02-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-04-07 15:03:12","updated_at":"2021-04-09
