{"talk":{"id":71706,"name":"Angela Mahecha Adrar: The people who caused the climate crisis aren't the ones who will fix it","description":"Corporations and big business have wrecked the environment, but disadvantaged communities living in \"sacrifice zones\" -- urban areas heavily polluted and poisoned by industry -- are paying the price, says climate justice leader Angela Mahecha Adrar. Explaining why racial and economic justice must be at the center of climate action, she takes us to the frontline communities that are leading the world to clean, innovative and just climate solutions -- like Cooperativa Tierra y Libertad, a local farm co-op in Washington that's disrupting the multibillion-dollar berry business.","slug":"angela_mahecha_adrar_the_people_who_caused_the_climate_crisis_aren_t_the_ones_who_will_fix_it","recorded_at":"2020-12-09 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-02-24 16:01:35","updated_at":"2021-10-22 23:17:11","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":680,"name":"TED Salon UNDP"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/03db548891f500217d6686904ac5075cd02dc8c8_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/03db548891f500217d6686904ac5075cd02dc8c8_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/03db548891f500217d6686904ac5075cd02dc8c8_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/03db548891f500217d6686904ac5075cd02dc8c8_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c27ce7fe943b155728e4080cef2cd89eca228020_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6249101,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17298277,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":30671475,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43185310,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":57801695,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":88555722,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":137733427,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6513802,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43541591,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":89134666,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AngelaMahechaAdrar_2020S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7812238,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"languages":{"en":{"name":"English","native":true}},"tags":[{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6214,"name":"Angela Mahecha Adrar"}}],"ratings":[]}}
