{"talk":{"id":2173,"name":"Joe Madiath: Better toilets, better life","description":"In rural India, the lack of toilets creates a big, stinking problem. It leads to poor quality water, one of the leading causes of disease in India, and has a disproportionately negative effect on women. Joe Madiath introduces a program to help villagers help themselves, by building clean, protected water and sanitation systems and requiring everyone in the village to collaborate -- with significant benefits that ripple across health, education and even government.","slug":"joe_madiath_better_toilets_better_life","recorded_at":"2014-10-21 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-01-22
