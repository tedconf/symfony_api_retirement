{"talk":{"id":2643,"name":"Sharon Brous: It's time to reclaim religion","description":"At a moment when the world seems to be spinning out of control, religion might feel irrelevant -- or like part of the problem. But Rabbi Sharon Brous believes we can reinvent religion to meet the needs of modern life. In this impassioned talk, Brous shares four principles of a revitalized religious practice and offers faith of all kinds as a hopeful counter-narrative to the numbing realities of violence, extremism and pessimism.","slug":"sharon_brous_it_s_time_to_reclaim_religion","recorded_at":"2016-10-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-12-21 16:05:04","updated_at":"2021-04-09
