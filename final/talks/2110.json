{"talk":{"id":2110,"name":"Melissa Fleming: Let's help refugees thrive, not just survive","description":"Today's refugee crisis is the biggest since World War II, and it's growing. When this talk was given, 50 million people had been forcefully displaced from their homes by conflict and war; as of 2021, the number grew to more than 82 million. There were three million Syrian refugees in 2014; now there are 5.5 million languishing in neighboring countries. Inside this overwhelming crisis are the individual human stories -- of care, growth and family, in the face of lost education, lost home, lost future. Melissa Fleming of the United Nations tells the refugees' stories -- and asks us to help them rebuild their world.","slug":"melissa_fleming_let_s_help_refugees_thrive_not_just_survive","recorded_at":"2014-10-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-10-16 14:40:44","updated_at":"2021-06-23
