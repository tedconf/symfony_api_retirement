{"talk":{"id":65056,"name":"Shameran Abed: 4 steps to ending extreme poverty","description":"Approximately 700 million people worldwide currently live in extreme poverty, a state of severe financial and social vulnerability that robs many of hope and dignity. BRAC, the world's largest NGO, began a sustainable, multifaceted intervention called the Graduation approach in 2002. Since then, it has helped over nine million people escape extreme poverty. Now, Shameran Abed and BRAC Ultra-Poor Graduation Initiative (UPGI) have an audacious plan to partner with governments to bring this life-changing program to an additional 21 million people by 2026. (This ambitious plan is a part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change.)","slug":"shameran_abed_4_steps_to_ending_extreme_poverty","recorded_at":"2020-06-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-09-04 15:01:14","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:44:31","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e77cc8737466b5ab57c3f6911a5136a1c726b1cf_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e77cc8737466b5ab57c3f6911a5136a1c726b1cf_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e77cc8737466b5ab57c3f6911a5136a1c726b1cf_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e77cc8737466b5ab57c3f6911a5136a1c726b1cf_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/013dc37f65888298b0eaff96043b7c3860d2a8b2_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3557272,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9798322,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17349179,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24452535,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32679218,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50491534,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77803790,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3815790,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24971764,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50768044,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4610397,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10057299,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ShameranAbed_2020-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50764937,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"gl":{"name":"Galician"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uz":{"name":"Uzbek"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Audacious Project"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"international development"},{"tag":"poverty"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5724,"name":"Shameran Abed"}}],"ratings":[]}}
