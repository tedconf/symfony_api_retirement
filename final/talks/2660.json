{"talk":{"id":2660,"name":"George Tulevski: The next step in nanotechnology","description":"Nearly every other year the transistors that power silicon computer chip shrink in size by half and double in performance, enabling our devices to become more mobile and accessible. But what happens when these components can't get any smaller? George Tulevski researches the unseen and untapped world of nanomaterials. His current work: developing chemical processes to compel billions of carbon nanotubes to assemble themselves into the patterns needed to build circuits, much the same way natural organisms build intricate, diverse and elegant structures. Could they hold the secret to the next generation of computing?","slug":"george_tulevski_the_next_step_in_nanotechnology","recorded_at":"2016-11-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-01-10
