{"talk":{"id":6477,"name":"Nadine Hachach-Haram: How augmented reality could change the future of surgery","description":"If you're undergoing surgery, you want the best surgical team to collaborate on your case, no matter where they are. Surgeon and entrepreneur Nadine Hachach-Haram is developing a new system that helps surgeons operate together and train one another on new techniques -- from remote locations using low-cost augmented reality tools. Watch the system in action as she joins a surgeon in Minnesota performing a knee surgery, live on her laptop from the TED stage in New Orleans. As Hachach-Haram says: \"Through simple, everyday devices that we take for granted, we can really do miraculous things.\" (This talk contains graphic images of surgery.)","slug":"nadine_hachach_haram_how_augmented_reality_could_change_the_future_of_surgery","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-12-08 16:03:42","updated_at":"2020-11-22
