{"talk":{"id":1888,"name":"Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9: How to build with clay ... and community","description":"Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 knew exactly what he wanted to do when he got his degree in architecture... He wanted to go home to Gando in Burkina Faso, to help his neighbors reap the benefit of his education. In this charming talk, K\u00e9r\u00e9 shows off some of the beautiful structures he's helped to build in his small village in the years since then, including an award-winning primary school made from clay by the entire community.","slug":"diebedo_francis_kere_how_to_build_with_clay_and_community","recorded_at":"2013-09-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-12-10 16:00:18","updated_at":"2020-09-28
