{"talk":{"id":2524,"name":"Jamila Raqib: The secret to effective nonviolent resistance","description":"We're not going to end violence by telling people that it's morally wrong, says Jamila Raqib, executive director of the Albert Einstein Institution. Instead, we must find alternative ways to conduct conflict that are equally powerful and effective. Raqib promotes nonviolent resistance to people living under tyranny -- and there's a lot more to it than street protests. She shares encouraging examples of creative strategies that have led to change around the world and a message of hope for a future without armed conflict. \"The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete,\" Raqib says.","slug":"jamila_raqib_the_secret_to_effective_nonviolent_resistance","recorded_at":"2015-11-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-06-14
