{"talk":{"id":82733,"name":"Solomon Goldstein-Rose: How much clean electricity do we really need?","description":"To fight climate change, we need to clean up the global electricity system by replacing fossil fuel power plants with clean generation -- right? Climate author Solomon Goldstein-Rose thinks we need to do much more than that. Replacement isn't enough, he explains in this compelling talk: we need to rapidly develop a new global system capable of producing 12 times the amount of clean electricity we generate today. He shares four reasons why we need that expansion -- first, to electrify everything in all parts of the world (not just the wealthy ones) -- as well as some intriguing ideas for how we can get there.","slug":"solomon_goldstein_rose_how_much_clean_electricity_do_we_really_need","recorded_at":"2021-10-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-10-20 15:11:14","updated_at":"2021-10-29 12:44:36","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":729,"name":"Countdown Summit"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1fa903defdf66e5a0d8d3bda0a8c1796b06a1465_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1fa903defdf66e5a0d8d3bda0a8c1796b06a1465_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1fa903defdf66e5a0d8d3bda0a8c1796b06a1465_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1fa903defdf66e5a0d8d3bda0a8c1796b06a1465_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/37dc58a207f95edef108b323ffad15bc8f6ba66d_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4846359,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13371335,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23732880,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33452826,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44844144,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":70237010,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":108376175,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5111407,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33808940,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":70797880,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SolomonGoldsteinRose_2021T.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6050278,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Countdown"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"electricity"},{"tag":"energy"},{"tag":"fossil fuels"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"renewable energy"},{"tag":"sustainability"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6437,"name":"Solomon Goldstein-Rose"}}],"ratings":[]}}
