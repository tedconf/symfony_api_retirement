{"talk":{"id":15275,"name":"Kirsty Duncan: Scientists must be free to learn, to speak and to challenge","description":"\"You do not mess with something so fundamental, so precious, as science,\" says Kirsty Duncan, Canada's first Minister of Science. In a heartfelt, inspiring talk about pushing boundaries, she makes the case that researchers must be free to present uncomfortable truths and challenge the thinking of the day -- and that we all have a duty to speak up when we see science being stifled or suppressed.","slug":"kirsty_duncan_scientists_must_be_free_to_learn_to_speak_and_to_challenge","recorded_at":"2018-04-10
