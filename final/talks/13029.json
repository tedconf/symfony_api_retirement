{"talk":{"id":13029,"name":"Nancy Rabalais: The \"dead zone\" of the Gulf of Mexico","description":"Ocean expert Nancy Rabalais tracks the ominously named \"dead zone\" in the Gulf of Mexico -- where there isn't enough oxygen in the water to support life. The Gulf has the second largest dead zone in the world; on top of killing fish and crustaceans, it's also killing fisheries in these waters. Rabalais tells us about what's causing it -- and how we can reverse its harmful effects and restore one of America's natural treasures.","slug":"nancy_rabalais_the_dead_zone_of_the_gulf_of_mexico","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-18 20:00:31","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:43:19","viewed_count":1159348,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":471,"name":"TEDWomen 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/55a933d5db56261ff8c578b347a0237b667bba51_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/55a933d5db56261ff8c578b347a0237b667bba51_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/55a933d5db56261ff8c578b347a0237b667bba51_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/55a933d5db56261ff8c578b347a0237b667bba51_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c0530d4ecf04b18148881cf3c2f3a2bbbf073bca_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5985519,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16504699,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":29235254,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41194204,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55154645,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":86602903,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":133970229,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6199637,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41360157,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":86739378,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7304673,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16763780,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NancyRabalais_2017W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":86737941,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"biosphere"},{"tag":"farming"},{"tag":"food"},{"tag":"marine biology"},{"tag":"ocean"},{"tag":"pollution"},{"tag":"science"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3616,"name":"Nancy Rabalais"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":89}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":46}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":20}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":13}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":30}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":3}}]}}
