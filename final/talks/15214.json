{"talk":{"id":15214,"name":"Dylan Marron: Empathy is not endorsement","description":"Digital creator Dylan Marron has racked up millions of views for projects like \"Every Single Word\" and \"Sitting in Bathrooms With Trans People\" -- but he's found that the flip side of success online is internet hate. Over time, he's developed an unexpected coping mechanism: calling the people who leave him insensitive comments and asking a simple question: \"Why did you write that?\" In a thoughtful talk about how we interact online, Marron explains how sometimes the most subversive thing you can do is actually speak with people you disagree with, not simply at them.","slug":"dylan_marron_empathy_is_not_endorsement","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-27 14:49:16","updated_at":"2021-04-13
