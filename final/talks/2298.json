{"talk":{"id":2298,"name":"Alaa Murabit: What my religion really says about women","description":"Strong faith is a core part of Alaa Murabit's identity -- but when she moved from Canada to Libya as a young woman, she was surprised how the tenets of Islam were used to severely limit women's rights, independence and ability to lead. She wondered: Was this really religious doctrine? With humor, passion and a refreshingly rebellious spirt, she shares how she found examples of female leaders across the history of her faith \u2014 and how she speaks up for women using verses from the Koran.","slug":"alaa_murabit_what_my_religion_really_says_about_women","recorded_at":"2015-05-29 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-07-21 15:32:57","updated_at":"2021-04-09
