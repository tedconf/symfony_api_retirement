{"talk":{"id":602,"name":"Jim Fallon: Exploring the mind of a killer","description":"Psychopathic killers are the basis for some must-watch TV, but what really makes them tick? Neuroscientist Jim Fallon talks about brain scans and genetic analysis that may uncover the rotten wiring in the nature (and nurture) of murderers. In a too-strange-for-fiction twist, he shares a fascinating family history that makes his work chillingly personal.","slug":"jim_fallon_exploring_the_mind_of_a_killer","recorded_at":"2009-02-05
