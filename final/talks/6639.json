{"talk":{"id":6639,"name":"Sue Jaye Johnson: What we don't teach kids about sex","description":"As parents, it's our job to teach our kids about sex. But beyond \"the talk,\" which covers biology and reproduction, there's so much more we can say about the human experience of being in our bodies. Introducing \"The Talk 2.0,\" Sue Jaye Johnson shows us how we can teach our children to tune in to their sensations and provide them with the language to communicate their desires and emotions -- without shutting down or numbing out.","slug":"sue_jaye_johnson_what_we_don_t_teach_kids_about_sex","recorded_at":"2017-06-06 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-04 21:00:45","updated_at":"2021-10-22
