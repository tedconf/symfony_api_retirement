{"talk":{"id":2128,"name":"Alejandro Aravena: My architectural philosophy? Bring the community into the process","description":"When asked to build housing for 100 families in Chile ten years ago, Alejandro Aravena looked to an unusual inspiration: the wisdom of favelas and slums. Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution \u2014 one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit.","slug":"alejandro_aravena_my_architectural_philosophy_bring_the_community_into_the_process","recorded_at":"2014-10-09 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-11-06 15:51:08","updated_at":"2020-09-28
