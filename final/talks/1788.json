{"talk":{"id":1788,"name":"Bernie Krause: The voice of the natural world","description":"Bernie Krause has been recording wild soundscapes -- the wind in the trees, the chirping of birds, the subtle sounds of insect larvae -- for 45 years. In that time, he has seen many environments radically altered by humans, sometimes even by practices thought to be environmentally safe. A surprising look at what we can learn through nature's symphonies, from the grunting of a sea anemone to the sad calls of a beaver in mourning.","slug":"bernie_krause_the_voice_of_the_natural_world","recorded_at":"2013-06-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-07-15 15:02:42","updated_at":"2021-01-22
