{"talk":{"id":1655,"name":"Tyler DeWitt: Hey science teachers -- make it fun","description":"High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about his new lesson plan on bacteria (how cool!) -- and devastated when his students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations.","slug":"tyler_dewitt_hey_science_teachers_make_it_fun","recorded_at":"2012-11-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-02-05 16:02:47","updated_at":"2021-04-09
