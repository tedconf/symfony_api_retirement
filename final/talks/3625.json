{"talk":{"id":3625,"name":"Shonda Rhimes and Cyndi Stivers: The future of storytelling","description":"\"We all feel a compelling need to watch stories, to tell stories ... to discuss the things that tell each one of us that we are not alone in the world,\" says TV titan Shonda Rhimes. A dominant force in television since \"Grey's Anatomy\" hit the airwaves, Rhimes discusses the future of media networks, how she's using her narrative-building skills as a force for good, an intriguing concept known as \"Amish summers\" and much more, in conversation with Cyndi Stivers, director of the TED Residency.","slug":"shonda_rhimes_and_cyndi_stivers_the_future_of_storytelling","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-10-30 15:09:38","updated_at":"2021-10-22
