{"talk":{"id":1915,"name":"McKenna Pope: Want to be an activist? Start with your toys","description":"McKenna Pope's younger brother loved to cook, but he worried about using an Easy-Bake Oven -- because it was a toy for girls. So at age 13, Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing. In a heartening talk, Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless.","slug":"mckenna_pope_want_to_be_an_activist_start_with_your_toys","recorded_at":"2013-11-23 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-01-29 16:03:07","updated_at":"2021-10-23
