{"talk":{"id":66954,"name":"Tom Schuler: How we could make carbon-negative concrete","description":"Concrete is all around us: we use it to build our roads, buildings, bridges and much more. Yet over the last 2,000 years, the art of mixing cement and using it to bind concrete hasn't changed very much -- and it remains one of the world's biggest emitters of carbon. Entrepreneur Tom Schuler previews an innovative way to create concrete, potentially turning it into a carbon sink that traps CO2 from the atmosphere -- while producing a viable building material.","slug":"tom_schuler_how_we_could_make_carbon_negative_concrete","recorded_at":"2020-10-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-01-04 16:00:32","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:33:20","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":620,"name":"Countdown"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1d6775ef7045b6ffb6133e54069b7504fad2ff06_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1d6775ef7045b6ffb6133e54069b7504fad2ff06_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1d6775ef7045b6ffb6133e54069b7504fad2ff06_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1d6775ef7045b6ffb6133e54069b7504fad2ff06_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/810d8ce6499bf5e3db6905c9c2de47e49ee7f250_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":2423539,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6634158,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11753409,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16598242,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22230477,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34482514,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52712536,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":2682025,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17117395,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34759292,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3251515,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6888520,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TomSchuler_2020T-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34769052,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Countdown"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"engineering"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"sustainability"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6089,"name":"Tom Schuler"}}],"ratings":[]}}
