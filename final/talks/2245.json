{"talk":{"id":2245,"name":"Tal Danino: Programming bacteria to detect cancer (and maybe treat it)","description":"Liver cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to detect, but synthetic biologist Tal Danino had a left-field thought: What if we could create a probiotic, edible bacteria that was \"programmed\" to find liver tumors? His insight exploits something we're just beginning to understand about bacteria: their power of quorum sensing, or doing something together once they reach critical mass. Danino, a TED Fellow, explains how quorum sensing works -- and how clever bacteria working together could someday change cancer treatment.","slug":"tal_danino_programming_bacteria_to_detect_cancer_and_maybe_treat_it","recorded_at":"2015-03-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-05-07 15:03:26","updated_at":"2020-09-28
