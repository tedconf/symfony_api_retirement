{"talk":{"id":2254,"name":"Steven Wise: Chimps have feelings and thoughts. They should also have rights","description":"Chimpanzees are people too, you know. Ok, not exactly. But lawyer Steven Wise has spent the last 30 years working to change these animals' status from \"things\" to \"persons.\" It's not a matter of legal semantics; as he describes in this fascinating talk, recognizing that animals like chimps have extraordinary cognitive capabilities and rethinking the way we treat them -- legally -- is no less than a moral duty.","slug":"steven_wise_chimps_have_feelings_and_thoughts_they_should_also_have_rights","recorded_at":"2015-03-25 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-05-20 15:00:43","updated_at":"2020-09-28
