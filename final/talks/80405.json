In this bold, actionable talk, Ross gives us a toolkit for starting productive conversations instead of fights -- what she calls a \"call-in culture\" -- and shares strategies that help challenge wrongdoing while still creating space for growth, forgiveness and maybe even an unexpected friend. \"Fighting hate should be fun,\" Ross says. \"It's being a hater that sucks.\"","slug":"loretta_j_ross_don_t_call_people_out_call_them_in","recorded_at":"2021-08-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-08-04 14:52:39","updated_at":"2021-10-14 12:27:58","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":724,"name":"TEDMonterey"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ac6ede0c3c675bdbc85a92091a242d4b7ce936d9_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ac6ede0c3c675bdbc85a92091a242d4b7ce936d9_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ac6ede0c3c675bdbc85a92091a242d4b7ce936d9_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ac6ede0c3c675bdbc85a92091a242d4b7ce936d9_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b58ca03e6a7acec8ce7c11ee8572f5d9037c4630_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7030213,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19490421,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34507045,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48605175,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65010416,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102106280,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":158187578,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7244469,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48771250,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102243083,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8716056,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19753289,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LorettaJRoss_2021-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102244232,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"}},"tags":[{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"communication"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"social media"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6401,"name":"Loretta J.
