{"talk":{"id":2370,"name":"Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols: This is what LGBT life is like around the world","description":"As a gay couple in San Francisco, Jenni Chang and Lisa Dazols had a relatively easy time living the way they wanted. But outside the bubble of the Bay Area, what was life like for people still lacking basic rights? They set off on a world tour in search of \"Supergays,\" LGBT people who were doing something extraordinary in the world. In 15 countries across Africa, Asia and South America -- from India, recently home to the world's first openly gay prince, to Argentina, the first country in Latin America to grant marriage equality -- they found the inspiring stories and the courageous, resilient and proud Supergays they had been looking for.","slug":"jenni_chang_and_lisa_dazols_this_is_what_lgbt_life_is_like_around_the_world","recorded_at":"2015-05-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-11-09 16:09:45","updated_at":"2021-04-09
