{"talk":{"id":25368,"name":"Aparna Mehta: Where do your online returns go?","description":"Do you ever order clothes online in different sizes and colors, just to try them on and then send back what doesn't work? Aparna Mehta used to do this all time, until she one day asked herself: Where do all these returned clothes go? In an eye-opening talk, she reveals the unseen world of \"free\" online returns -- which, instead of ending up back on the shelf, are sent to landfills by the billions of pounds each year -- and shares a plan to help put an end to this growing environmental catastrophe.","slug":"aparna_mehta_where_do_your_online_returns_go","recorded_at":"2018-07-19 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-11-21 15:52:15","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:27:55","viewed_count":1377660,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":383,"name":"TED@UPS"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2617560d60af6298506d86fea436093f1222f4a0_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2617560d60af6298506d86fea436093f1222f4a0_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2617560d60af6298506d86fea436093f1222f4a0_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2617560d60af6298506d86fea436093f1222f4a0_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1e0322d32e2873414aeb5c8300431e0d4d791116_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3790320,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10464524,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18558831,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26210278,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35211963,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55110607,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":84751866,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4004616,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26376193,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55247275,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4684590,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10723668,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AparnaMehta_2018S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55240594,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sw":{"name":"Swahili"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"}},"tags":[{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"consumerism"},{"tag":"engineering"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"fashion"},{"tag":"pollution"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"sustainability"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4167,"name":"Aparna Mehta"}}],"ratings":[]}}
