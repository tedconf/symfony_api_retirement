{"talk":{"id":36415,"name":"Olympia Della Flora: Creative ways to get kids to thrive in school","description":"To get young kids to thrive in school, we need to do more than teach them how to read and write -- we need to teach them how to manage their emotions, says educator Olympia Della Flora. In this practical talk, she shares creative tactics she used to help struggling, sometimes disruptive students -- things like stopping for brain breaks, singing songs and even doing yoga poses -- all with her existing budget and resources. \"Small changes make huge differences, and it's possible to start right now ...
