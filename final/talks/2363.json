{"talk":{"id":2363,"name":"Cesar Harada: How I teach kids to love science","description":"At the Harbour School in Hong Kong, TED Senior Fellow Cesar Harada teaches citizen science and invention to the next generation of environmentalists. He's moved his classroom into an industrial mega-space where imaginative kids work with wood, metal, chemistry, biology, optics and, occasionally, power tools to create solutions to the threats facing the world's oceans. There, he instills a universal lesson that his own parents taught him at a young age: \"You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself.\"","slug":"cesar_harada_how_i_teach_kids_to_love_science","recorded_at":"2015-08-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-10-27 15:24:11","updated_at":"2021-04-09
