{"talk":{"id":1214,"name":"Julia Bacha: Pay attention to nonviolence","description":"In 2003, the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves.

peace.","slug":"julia_bacha_pay_attention_to_nonviolence","recorded_at":"2011-07-13 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-08-31 15:10:16","updated_at":"2021-04-09
