{"talk":{"id":76208,"name":"Feras Fayyad: The real-life superheroes helping Syrian refugees","description":"Society has a set of stories it tells itself about who refugees are and what they look like, says documentarian and TED Fellow Feras Fayyad. With his films, he's on a mission to separate the facts about refugees from fiction, as a form of resistance -- for himself, his daughter and the millions of other Syrian refugees across the world. A harrowing account, a quest to end injustice and a testament to the power of storytelling.","slug":"feras_fayyad_the_real_life_superheroes_helping_syrian_refugees","recorded_at":"2021-05-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-06-10 15:35:36","updated_at":"2021-10-13 04:55:10","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":713,"name":"TED Fellows: Shape Your Future"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f94df3c5d4d7e5d9324671c33b6c2a45a4319c4f_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f94df3c5d4d7e5d9324671c33b6c2a45a4319c4f_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f94df3c5d4d7e5d9324671c33b6c2a45a4319c4f_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f94df3c5d4d7e5d9324671c33b6c2a45a4319c4f_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/a49e027663107f04319c45c8e9266eb1ec0fba4d_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3269936,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8953074,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15917789,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22485068,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":30214626,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47251864,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72535170,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3535125,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22841180,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47812936,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4003057,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9229071,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FerasFayyad_2021F-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47830234,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"film"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"refugees"},{"tag":"storytelling"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5986,"name":"Feras Fayyad"}}],"ratings":[]}}
