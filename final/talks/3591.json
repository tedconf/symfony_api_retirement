{"talk":{"id":3591,"name":"In\u00e9s Hercovich: Why women stay silent after sexual assault","description":"Why do women who experience sexual assault rarely speak up about it? \"Because they fear they won't be believed,\" says In\u00e9s Hercovich. \"Because when a woman tells what happened to her, she tells us things we can't imagine, things that disturb us, things we don't expect to hear, things that shock us.\" In this moving talk, she takes us inside an encounter with sexual assault to give us a clearer idea of what these situations really look like -- and the difficult choices women make to survive.
