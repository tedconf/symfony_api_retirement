{"talk":{"id":2497,"name":"Dan Pallotta: The dream we haven't dared to dream","description":"What are your dreams? Better yet, what are your broken dreams? Dan Pallotta dreams of a time when we are as excited, curious and scientific about the development of our humanity as we are about the development of our technology. \"What we fear most is that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential,\" Pallotta says. \"Imagine living in a world where we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another -- and love one another boldly because we know that to be human is to live with that fear.\"","slug":"dan_pallotta_the_dream_we_haven_t_dared_to_dream","recorded_at":"2016-02-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-05-04
