{"talk":{"id":20008,"name":"Pratik Shah: How AI is making it easier to diagnose disease","description":"Today's AI algorithms require tens of thousands of expensive medical images to detect a patient's disease. What if we could drastically reduce the amount of data needed to train an AI, making diagnoses low-cost and more effective? TED Fellow Pratik Shah is working on a clever system to do just that. Using an unorthodox AI approach, Shah has developed a technology that requires as few as 50 images to develop a working algorithm -- and can even use photos taken on doctors' cell phones to provide a diagnosis. Learn more about how this new way to analyze medical information could lead to earlier detection of life-threatening illnesses and bring AI-assisted diagnosis to more health care settings worldwide.","slug":"pratik_shah_how_ai_is_making_it_easier_to_diagnose_disease","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-07-24 14:41:50","updated_at":"2021-04-13
