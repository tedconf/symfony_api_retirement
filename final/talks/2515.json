{"talk":{"id":2515,"name":"Samantha Nutt: The real harm of the global arms trade","description":"In some parts of the world, it's easier to get an automatic rifle than a glass of clean drinking water. Is this just the way it is? Samantha Nutt, doctor and founder of the international humanitarian organization War Child, explores the global arms trade -- and suggests a bold, common sense solution for ending the cycle of violence. \"War is ours,\" she says. \"We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.
