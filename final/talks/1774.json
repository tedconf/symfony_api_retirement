{"talk":{"id":1774,"name":"Peter Attia: Is the obesity crisis hiding a bigger problem?","description":"As a young surgeon, Peter Attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes. She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.","slug":"peter_attia_is_the_obesity_crisis_hiding_a_bigger_problem","recorded_at":"2013-04-05
