{"talk":{"id":1818,"name":"Ron McCallum: How technology allowed me to read","description":"Months after he was born, in 1948, Ron McCallum became blind. In this charming, moving talk, he shows how he reads -- and celebrates the progression of clever tools and adaptive computer technologies that make it possible. With their help, and the help of volunteers, he's become a lawyer, an academic, and, most of all, a voracious reader. Welcome to the blind reading revolution.","slug":"ron_mccallum_how_technology_allowed_me_to_read","recorded_at":"2013-07-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-09-11 15:27:28","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:46:59","viewed_count":707006,"emailed_count":95,"event":{"id":121,"name":"TEDxSydney"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d56766057ccb1fe9d93db404b9aa9c6065d2131a_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d56766057ccb1fe9d93db404b9aa9c6065d2131a_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d56766057ccb1fe9d93db404b9aa9c6065d2131a_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"1600x1200","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d56766057ccb1fe9d93db404b9aa9c6065d2131a_1600x1200.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7778942,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21476230,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38057937,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53560540,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":71600946,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":110858205,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":172340262,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7916210,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53848191,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111269380,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21736550,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RonMcCallum_2013X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111257371,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"zh":{"name":"Chinese, Yue"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fi":{"name":"Finnish"},"fr":{"name":"French"},"fr-ca":{"name":"French (Canada)"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ms":{"name":"Malay"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"books"},{"tag":"decision-making"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"disability"},{"tag":"sight"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":6,"name":"What's Next in Tech"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1680,"name":"Ron McCallum"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":293}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":79}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":13}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":68}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":89}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":19}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":126}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":45}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":7}}]}}
