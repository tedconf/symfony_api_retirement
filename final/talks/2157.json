{"talk":{"id":2157,"name":"Mundano: Trash cart superheroes","description":"In Brazil, \"catadores\" collect junk and recyclables. But while they provide a vital service that benefits all, they are nearly invisible as they roam the streets. Enter graffiti artist Mundano, a TED Fellow. In a spirited talk, he describes his project \"Pimp My Carro\u00e7a,\" which has transformed these heroic workers' carts into things of beauty and infused them with a sense of humor. It's a movement that is going global.","slug":"mundano_trash_cart_superheroes","recorded_at":"2014-10-06 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-12-19 16:18:48","updated_at":"2020-09-28
