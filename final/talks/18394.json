{"talk":{"id":18394,"name":"Essam Daod: How we can bring mental health support to refugees","description":"The global refugee crisis is a mental health catastrophe, leaving millions in need of psychological support to overcome the traumas of dislocation and conflict. To undo the damage, child psychiatrist and TED Fellow Essam Daod has been working in camps, rescue boats and the shorelines of Greece and the Mediterranean Sea to help refugees (a quarter of which are children) reframe their experiences through short, powerful psychological interventions. \"We can all do something to prevent this mental health catastrophe,\" Daod says. \"We need to acknowledge that first aid is not just needed for the body, but it has also to include the mind, the soul.\"","slug":"essam_daod_how_we_can_bring_mental_health_support_to_refugees","recorded_at":"2018-04-10
