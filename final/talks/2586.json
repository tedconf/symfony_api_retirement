{"talk":{"id":2586,"name":"Nadia Lopez: Why open a school? To close a prison","description":"Our kids are our future, and it's crucial they believe it themselves. That's why Nadia Lopez opened an academic oasis in Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in New York -- because she believes in every child's brilliance and capabilities. In this short, energizing talk, the founding principal of Mott Hall Bridges Academy (and a star of Humans of New York) shares how she helps her scholars envision a brighter future for themselves and their families.","slug":"nadia_lopez_why_open_a_school_to_close_a_prison","recorded_at":"2015-11-02 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-09-21 14:59:41","updated_at":"2021-04-09
