{"talk":{"id":28318,"name":"Darrick Hamilton: How \"baby bonds\" could help close the wealth gap","description":"Hard work, resilience and grit lead to success, right? This narrative pervades the way we think, says economist Darrick Hamilton, but the truth is that our chances at economic security have less to do with what we do and more to do with the wealth position we're born into. Enter \"baby bonds\": trust accounts of up to $60,000 for every newborn, calibrated to the wealth of their family. Learn how this bold proposal could help us reduce inequality -- and give every child personal seed money for important things like going to college, buying a home or starting a business. \"Without capital, inequality is locked in,\" Hamilton says. \"When it comes to economic security, wealth is both the beginning and the end.\"","slug":"darrick_hamilton_how_baby_bonds_could_help_close_the_wealth_gap","recorded_at":"2018-09-25 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-12-18 21:00:01","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:29:31","viewed_count":1110693,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":559,"name":"We the Future"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/646b8d687d3a29274ac0276d46580fb0bc640c93_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/646b8d687d3a29274ac0276d46580fb0bc640c93_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/646b8d687d3a29274ac0276d46580fb0bc640c93_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/646b8d687d3a29274ac0276d46580fb0bc640c93_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e3ea697a386a6f5694732d95eb0986eb386fc3bb_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6235004,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17280379,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":30603175,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43109349,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":57705792,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90554512,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":140164820,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6449276,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43275329,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90691086,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7729687,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17534830,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DarrickHamilton_2018S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90707020,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"government"},{"tag":"international development"},{"tag":"money"},{"tag":"policy"},{"tag":"poverty"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4788,"name":"Darrick Hamilton"}}],"ratings":[]}}
