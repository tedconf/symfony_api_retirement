{"talk":{"id":2372,"name":"Chelsea Shields: How I'm working for change inside my church","description":"How do we respect someone's religious beliefs, while also holding religion accountable for the damage those beliefs may cause? Chelsea Shields has a bold answer to this question. She was raised in the orthodox Mormon tradition, and she spent the early part of her life watching women be excluded from positions of importance within the LDS Church. Now, this anthropologist, activist and TED Fellow is working to reform her church's institutionalized gender inequality. \"Religions can liberate or subjugate, they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy,\" she says. \"What is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics, our health policy, violence around the world.\"","slug":"chelsea_shields_how_i_m_working_for_change_inside_my_church","recorded_at":"2015-08-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-11-12 16:13:10","updated_at":"2021-04-09
