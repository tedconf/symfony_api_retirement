{"talk":{"id":2297,"name":"Aspen Baker: A better way to talk about abortion","description":"Abortion is extremely common. In America, for example, one in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime, yet the strong emotions sparked by the topic -- and the highly politicized rhetoric around it -- leave little room for thoughtful, open debate. In this personal, thoughtful talk, Aspen Baker makes the case for being neither \u201cpro-life\u201d nor \u201cpro-choice\u201d but rather \"pro-voice\" -- and for the roles that listening and storytelling can play when it comes to discussing difficult topics.","slug":"aspen_baker_a_better_way_to_talk_about_abortion","recorded_at":"2015-05-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-07-14
