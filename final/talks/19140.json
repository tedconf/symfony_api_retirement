{"talk":{"id":19140,"name":"Anna Rothschild: Why you should love gross science","description":"What can we learn from the slimy, smelly side of life? In this playful talk, science journalist Anna Rothschild shows us the hidden wisdom of \"gross stuff\" and explains why avoiding the creepy underbelly of nature, medicine and technology closes us off to important sources of knowledge about our health and the world. \"When we explore the gross side of life, we find insights that we never would have thought we'd find, and we even often reveal beauty that we didn't think was there,\" Rothschild says.","slug":"anna_rothschild_why_you_should_love_gross_science","recorded_at":"2016-10-21 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-06-21
