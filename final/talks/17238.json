{"talk":{"id":17238,"name":"Hugh Herr: How we'll become cyborgs and extend human potential","description":"Humans will soon have new bodies that forever blur the line between the natural and synthetic worlds, says bionics designer Hugh Herr. In an unforgettable talk, he details \"NeuroEmbodied Design,\" a methodology for creating cyborg function that he's developing at the MIT Media Lab, and shows us a future where we've augmented our bodies in a way that will redefine human potential -- and, maybe, turn us into superheroes. \"During the twilight years of this century, I believe humans will be unrecognizable in morphology and dynamics from what we are today,\" Herr says. \"Humanity will take flight and soar.\"","slug":"hugh_herr_how_we_ll_become_cyborgs_and_extend_human_potential","recorded_at":"2018-04-10
