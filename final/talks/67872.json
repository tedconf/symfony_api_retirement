Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.","slug":"van_jones_what_if_a_us_presidential_candidate_refuses_to_concede_after_an_election","recorded_at":"2020-10-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-11-03 16:01:45","updated_at":"2021-03-22 18:12:18","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":420,"name":"TED Studio"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bc916aaf98f5124a1bfce9c3007a56c90ec9ad07_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bc916aaf98f5124a1bfce9c3007a56c90ec9ad07_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bc916aaf98f5124a1bfce9c3007a56c90ec9ad07_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bc916aaf98f5124a1bfce9c3007a56c90ec9ad07_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1d62bf64eb87131f495c9ff4af1f3f2c237cba14_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8101573,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22475228,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39787610,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":56013485,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":74893520,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":117629282,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":182466289,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8315731,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":56179679,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":117766167,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10105012,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22741136,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VanJones_2020V-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":117796425,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"United States"},{"tag":"democracy"},{"tag":"government"},{"tag":"law"},{"tag":"politics"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":933,"name":"Van Jones"}}],"ratings":[]}}
