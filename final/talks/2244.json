{"talk":{"id":2244,"name":"Greg Gage: How to control someone else's arm with your brain","description":"Greg Gage is on a mission to make brain science accessible to all. In this fun, kind of creepy demo, the neuroscientist and TED Senior Fellow uses a simple, inexpensive DIY kit to take away the free will of an audience member.
