{"talk":{"id":1799,"name":"Eli Beer: The fastest ambulance? A motorcycle","description":"As a young EMT on a Jerusalem ambulance, Eli Beer realized that, stuck in brutal urban traffic, they often arrived too late to help. So he organized a group of volunteer EMTs -- many on foot -- ready to drop everything and dash to save lives in their neighborhood. Today, United Hatzlah uses a smartphone app and a fleet of \"ambucycles\" to help nearby patients until an ambulance arrives. With an average response time of 3 minutes, last year, they treated 207,000 people in Israel. And the idea is going global.","slug":"eli_beer_the_fastest_ambulance_a_motorcycle","recorded_at":"2013-04-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-07-30 15:03:01","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:16:53","viewed_count":1098173,"emailed_count":219,"event":{"id":279,"name":"TEDMED 2013"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/aa8d0403aec3466d031e3e1c1605637d84d6a07d_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/aa8d0403aec3466d031e3e1c1605637d84d6a07d_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/aa8d0403aec3466d031e3e1c1605637d84d6a07d_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"1600x1200","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/aa8d0403aec3466d031e3e1c1605637d84d6a07d_1600x1200.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5314595,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14713696,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26022965,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36499341,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48537641,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":74590854,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":117083467,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5415719,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36697972,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":75109787,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6698890,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":74845576,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EliBeer_2013P-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14836889,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ms":{"name":"Malay"},"nb":{"name":"Norwegian Bokmal"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"ur":{"name":"Urdu"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDMED"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"health care"},{"tag":"medicine"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":47,"name":"Medicine Without Borders"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1671,"name":"Eli Beer"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":432}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":68}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":181}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":48}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":63}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":135}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":67}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":50}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":3}}]}}
