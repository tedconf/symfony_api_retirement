{"talk":{"id":73722,"name":"Jodi-Ann Burey: The myth of bringing your full, authentic self to work","description":"Calls for authenticity at work ask for passionate people with diverse, fresh perspectives who challenge old ways of thinking. But too often workplace culture fails to support the authenticity of professionals of color and other underrepresented groups, leading instead to backlash and fewer opportunities. Writer Jodi-Ann Burey outlines steps toward exposing privilege and achieving true equity on the job -- and implores those in leadership positions to accept responsibility for change.","slug":"jodi_ann_burey_the_myth_of_bringing_your_full_authentic_self_to_work","recorded_at":"2020-11-21 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-03-08 16:06:17","updated_at":"2021-10-18 10:21:41","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":530,"name":"TEDxSeattle"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/858cc1d858b5935d80c027948d363fbca6589cd5_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/858cc1d858b5935d80c027948d363fbca6589cd5_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/858cc1d858b5935d80c027948d363fbca6589cd5_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/858cc1d858b5935d80c027948d363fbca6589cd5_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/14d97b234562b0cb0e98a12758f802366ea1222f_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7666672,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21266639,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37635666,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52985630,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":70852633,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111193868,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":172537579,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7880645,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53151563,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111330547,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9631137,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21518770,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JodiAnnBurey_2020X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111341040,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"diversity"},{"tag":"inclusion"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"race"},{"tag":"work"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6270,"name":"Jodi-Ann Burey"}}],"ratings":[]}}
