{"talk":{"id":1859,"name":"Rodrigo Canales: The deadly genius of drug cartels","description":"Up to 100,000 people died in drug-related violence in Mexico in the last 6 years. We might think this has nothing to do with us, but in fact we are all complicit, says Yale professor Rodrigo Canales in this unflinching talk that turns conventional wisdom about drug cartels on its head. The carnage is not about faceless, ignorant goons mindlessly killing each other but is rather the result of some seriously sophisticated brand management.","slug":"rodrigo_canales_the_deadly_genius_of_drug_cartels","recorded_at":"2013-10-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-11-04 16:01:14","updated_at":"2021-04-09
