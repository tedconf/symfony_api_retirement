{"talk":{"id":13000,"name":"Andrew Dent: To eliminate waste, we need to rediscover thrift","description":"There's no such thing as throwing something away, says Andrew Dent -- when you toss a used food container, broken toy or old pair of socks into the trash, those things inevitably end up in ever-growing landfills. But we can get smarter about the way we make, and remake, our products. Dent shares exciting examples of thrift -- the idea of using and reusing what you need so you don't have to purchase anything new -- as well as advances in material science, like electronics made of nanocellulose and enzymes that can help make plastic infinitely recyclable.","slug":"andrew_dent_to_eliminate_waste_we_need_to_rediscover_thrift","recorded_at":"2017-11-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-04 14:58:59","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:28:12","viewed_count":1289162,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":429,"name":"TEDNYC"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb4809d010c344bc791a024f86b2d31385d167ea_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb4809d010c344bc791a024f86b2d31385d167ea_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb4809d010c344bc791a024f86b2d31385d167ea_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb4809d010c344bc791a024f86b2d31385d167ea_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/10da298a07bb24a828c2f235712d017fc50b92f8_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5235648,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14488060,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25648879,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36082073,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48165674,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76223460,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":117549018,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5494476,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36601193,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76481906,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6430874,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14744208,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AndrewDent_2017S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76476484,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"engineering"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"nature"},{"tag":"plastic"},{"tag":"pollution"},{"tag":"sustainability"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3761,"name":"Andrew Dent"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":102}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":34}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":58}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":50}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":13}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":3}}]}}
