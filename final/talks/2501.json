{"talk":{"id":2501,"name":"Kang Lee: Can you really tell if a kid is lying?","description":"Are children poor liars? Do you think you can easily detect their lies? Developmental researcher Kang Lee studies what happens physiologically to children when they lie. They do it a lot, starting as young as two years old, and they're actually really good at it. Lee explains why we should celebrate when kids start to lie and presents new lie-detection technology that could someday reveal our hidden emotions.","slug":"kang_lee_can_you_really_tell_if_a_kid_is_lying","recorded_at":"2016-02-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-05-13 14:29:18","updated_at":"2021-04-09
