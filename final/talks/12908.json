{"talk":{"id":12908,"name":"Erica Stone: Academic research is publicly funded -- why isn't it publicly available?","description":"In the US, your taxes fund academic research at public universities. Why then do you need to pay expensive, for-profit journals for the results of that research? Erica Stone advocates for a new, open-access relationship between the public and scholars, making the case that academics should publish in more accessible media. \"A functioning democracy requires that the public be well-educated and well-informed,\" Stone says. \"Instead of research happening behind paywalls and bureaucracy, wouldn't it be better if it was unfolding right in front of us?\"","slug":"erica_stone_academic_research_is_publicly_funded_why_isn_t_it_publicly_available","recorded_at":"2016-10-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-28 15:00:07","updated_at":"2021-04-09
