{"talk":{"id":2193,"name":"Guy Winch: Why we all need to practice emotional first aid","description":"We'll go to the doctor when we feel flu-ish or a nagging pain. So why don't we see a health professional when we feel emotional pain: guilt, loss, loneliness? Too many of us deal with common psychological-health issues on our own, says Guy Winch. But we don't have to. He makes a compelling case to practice emotional hygiene \u2014 taking care of our emotions, our minds, with the same diligence we take care of our bodies.","slug":"guy_winch_why_we_all_need_to_practice_emotional_first_aid","recorded_at":"2014-11-07 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-02-16 16:08:15","updated_at":"2021-04-13
