{"talk":{"id":14608,"name":"Diane Wolk-Rogers: A Parkland teacher's homework for us all","description":"Diane Wolk-Rogers teaches history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, site of a horrific school shooting on Valentine's Day 2018. How can we end this senseless violence? In a stirring talk, Wolk-Rogers offers three ways Americans can move forward to create more safety and responsibility around guns -- and invites people to come up with their own answers, too. Above all, she asks us to take a cue from the student activists at her school, survivors whose work for change has moved millions to action. \"They shouldn't have to do this on their own,\" Wolk-Rogers says. \"They're asking you to get involved.\"","slug":"diane_wolk_rogers_a_parkland_teacher_s_homework_for_us_all","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-20
