{"talk":{"id":1603,"name":"Hannah Brencher: Love letters to strangers","description":"Hannah Brencher's mother always wrote her letters. So when she felt herself bottom into depression after college, she did what felt natural -- she wrote love letters and left them for strangers to find.

boost.","slug":"hannah_brencher_love_letters_to_strangers","recorded_at":"2012-06-07 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-11-14 16:01:58","updated_at":"2020-09-28
