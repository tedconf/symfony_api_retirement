{"talk":{"id":1933,"name":"Catherine Bracy: Why good hackers make good citizens","description":"Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion. As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk, it can be just as much a force for good as it is for evil. She spins through some inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu, Oakland and Mexico City \u2014 and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes to get involved.","slug":"catherine_bracy_why_good_hackers_make_good_citizens","recorded_at":"2013-09-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-02-25 16:07:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28
