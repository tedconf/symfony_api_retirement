{"talk":{"id":2557,"name":"Ed Boyden: A new way to study the brain's invisible secrets","description":"Neuroengineer Ed Boyden wants to know how the tiny biomolecules in our brains generate emotions, thoughts and feelings -- and he wants to find the molecular changes that lead to disorders like epilepsy and Alzheimer's. Rather than magnify these invisible structures with a microscope, he wondered: What if we physically enlarge them and make them easier to see? Learn how the same polymers used to make baby diapers swell could be a key to better understanding our brains.","slug":"ed_boyden_a_new_way_to_study_the_brain_s_invisible_secrets","recorded_at":"2016-06-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-07-21 15:14:39","updated_at":"2021-04-09
