{"talk":{"id":31633,"name":"Soraya Chemaly: The power of women's anger","description":"Anger is a powerful emotion -- it warns us of threat, insult, indignity and harm. But across the world, girls and women are taught that their anger is better left unvoiced, says author Soraya Chemaly. Why is that, and what might we lose in this silence? In a provocative, thoughtful talk, Chemaly explores the dangerous lie that anger isn't feminine, showing how women's rage is justified, healthy and a potential catalyst for change.","slug":"soraya_chemaly_the_power_of_women_s_anger","recorded_at":"2018-11-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-01-28 15:51:44","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:45:02","viewed_count":1305473,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":574,"name":"TEDWomen 2018"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e926ed300b2543112c54679e859bc7a36b0c3f21_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e926ed300b2543112c54679e859bc7a36b0c3f21_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e926ed300b2543112c54679e859bc7a36b0c3f21_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e926ed300b2543112c54679e859bc7a36b0c3f21_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/57fcab6448f06a1f61dc41bc3227dff193b16f0c_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5799611,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16047497,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28419292,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40046805,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53622432,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":84143234,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":130151199,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6013911,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40212777,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":84279923,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7116069,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16302278,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SorayaChemaly_2018W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":84284147,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"feminism"},{"tag":"gender"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"personal growth"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"women"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4926,"name":"Soraya Chemaly"}}],"ratings":[]}}
