{"talk":{"id":77981,"name":"Khadijah Tribble: How marijuana reform could repair, reclaim and restore communities","description":"The war on drugs in the United States undid much of the progress of the Civil Rights Movement -- and today, it continues to derail millions within marginalized communities with arrests, convictions and incarcerations for marijuana possession. As more states move to legalize cannabis, social entrepreneur and activist Khadijah Tribble calls for equitable reform that centers on the casualties of the war and its insidious policies and paves a path toward restorative justice.","slug":"khadijah_tribble_how_marijuana_reform_could_repair_reclaim_and_restore_communities","recorded_at":"2019-03-29 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-06-17 15:09:49","updated_at":"2021-09-28 21:05:05","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":120,"name":"TEDxMidAtlantic"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/963407df6bec8a675d0f1fc7ecf74710685be76a_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/963407df6bec8a675d0f1fc7ecf74710685be76a_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/963407df6bec8a675d0f1fc7ecf74710685be76a_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/963407df6bec8a675d0f1fc7ecf74710685be76a_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/57d129a3ea2386bf510b76559e9d9257a2d0f6d8_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5214474,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14426936,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25517537,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35883656,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47908295,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":74248264,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":114993443,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5473361,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36402394,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":74525012,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6473980,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14682429,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KhadijahTribble_2019X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":74554591,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"United States"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"justice system"},{"tag":"policy"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6409,"name":"Khadijah Tribble"}}],"ratings":[]}}
