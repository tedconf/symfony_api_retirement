{"talk":{"id":10360,"name":"Margaret Mitchell: How we can build AI to help humans, not hurt us","description":"As a research scientist at Google, Margaret Mitchell helps develop computers that can communicate about what they see and understand. She tells a cautionary tale about the gaps, blind spots and biases we subconsciously encode into AI -- and asks us to consider what the technology we create today will mean for tomorrow. \"All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence,\" Mitchell says. \"If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now.\"","slug":"margaret_mitchell_how_we_can_build_ai_to_help_humans_not_hurt_us","recorded_at":"2017-10-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-02-20 15:47:49","updated_at":"2021-04-13
