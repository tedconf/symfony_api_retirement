{"talk":{"id":2008,"name":"Wes Moore: How to talk to veterans about war","description":"Wes Moore joined the US Army to pay for college, but the experience became core to who he is. In this heartfelt talk, the paratrooper and captain -- who went on to write\u00a0\"The Other Wes Moore\" -- explains the shock of returning home from Afghanistan. He shares the single phrase he heard from civilians on repeat, and shows why it's just not sufficient. It's a call for all of us to ask veterans to tell their stories -- and listen.","slug":"wes_moore_how_to_talk_to_veterans_about_war","recorded_at":"2014-01-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-05-23 14:47:34","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:16:51","viewed_count":1853779,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":328,"name":"TEDSalon NY2014"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/774cc02ff8ca33cc400d461723556487bc9228de_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/774cc02ff8ca33cc400d461723556487bc9228de_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/774cc02ff8ca33cc400d461723556487bc9228de_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"1600x1200","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/774cc02ff8ca33cc400d461723556487bc9228de_1600x1200.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7099779,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19687269,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34857744,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49093952,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65675056,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102193521,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":158168879,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7233031,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49209183,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102212749,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8771444,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19940715,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WesMoore_2014S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102213512,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"PTSD"},{"tag":"communication"},{"tag":"military"},{"tag":"war"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":22,"name":"Master Storytellers"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1900,"name":"Wes Moore"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":278}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":32}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":348}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":28}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":188}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":64}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":57}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":19}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":99}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":13}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":6}}]}}
