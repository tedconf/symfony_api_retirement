{"talk":{"id":2827,"name":"Grace Kim: How cohousing can make us happier (and live longer)","description":"Loneliness doesn't always stem from being alone. For architect Grace Kim, loneliness is a function of how socially connected we feel to the people around us -- and it's often the result of the homes we live in. She shares an age-old antidote to isolation: cohousing, a way of living where people choose to share space with their neighbors, get to know them, and look after them. Rethink your home and how you live in it with this eye-opening talk.","slug":"grace_kim_how_cohousing_can_make_us_happier_and_live_longer","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-07-24 14:52:37","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:27:31","viewed_count":2072977,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":455,"name":"TED2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bfd5be588fc1b9e720130e4161bafb86b8adb592_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bfd5be588fc1b9e720130e4161bafb86b8adb592_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bfd5be588fc1b9e720130e4161bafb86b8adb592_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/bfd5be588fc1b9e720130e4161bafb86b8adb592_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e5ce3643d76d2f9fffd95c1bdec211e428038b3a_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5084649,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14051594,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24912467,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35138793,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47091604,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":73824762,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":114114211,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5298851,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35304622,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":73961245,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6219797,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14308111,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GraceKim_2017-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":73954373,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"te":{"name":"Telugu"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"architecture"},{"tag":"cities"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"urban planning"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3373,"name":"Grace Kim"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":217}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":60}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":97}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":135}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":27}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":76}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":3}}]}}
