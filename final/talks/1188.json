{"talk":{"id":1188,"name":"Rebecca MacKinnon: Let's take back the Internet!","description":"In this powerful talk from TEDGlobal, Rebecca MacKinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace, and asks: How do we design the next phase of the Internet with accountability and freedom at its core, rather than control? She believes the internet is headed for a \"Magna Carta\" moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection.","slug":"rebecca_mackinnon_let_s_take_back_the_internet","recorded_at":"2011-07-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-07-13 10:15:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
