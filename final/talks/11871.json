{"talk":{"id":11871,"name":"Sophie Andrews: The best way to help is often just to listen","description":"A 24-hour helpline in the UK known as Samaritans helped Sophie Andrews become a survivor of abuse rather than a victim. Now she's paying the favor back as the founder of The Silver Line, a helpline that supports lonely and isolated older people. In a powerful, personal talk, she shares why the simple act of listening (instead of giving advice) is often the best way to help someone in need.","slug":"sophie_andrews_the_best_way_to_help_is_often_just_to_listen","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-09 12:07:23","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:44:17","viewed_count":1550263,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":483,"name":"TEDMED 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9812798f5399fc6ec4f1682d253f4f87ff14aad9_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9812798f5399fc6ec4f1682d253f4f87ff14aad9_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9812798f5399fc6ec4f1682d253f4f87ff14aad9_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9812798f5399fc6ec4f1682d253f4f87ff14aad9_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f9109ba005f97be9a715b718740677e7d26d9f0d_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7105580,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19702585,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34858452,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49008048,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65366732,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103381851,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":159850619,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7364360,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49527368,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103640621,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8735924,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19955949,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SophieAndrews_2017P-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103637630,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDMED"},{"tag":"aging"},{"tag":"communication"},{"tag":"depression"},{"tag":"friendship"},{"tag":"mental health"},{"tag":"personal growth"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3721,"name":"Sophie Andrews"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":26}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":86}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":277}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":199}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":120}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":27}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":41}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":40}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":9}}]}}
