{"talk":{"id":2113,"name":"Fred Swaniker: The leaders who ruined Africa, and the generation who can fix it","description":"Before he hit eighteen, Fred Swaniker had lived in Ghana, Gambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. What he learned from a childhood across Africa was that while good leaders can't make much of a difference in societies with strong institutions, in countries with weak structures, leaders could make or break a country. In a passionate talk the entrepreneur and TED Fellow looks at different generations of African leaders and imagines how to develop the leadership of the future.","slug":"fred_swaniker_the_leaders_who_ruined_africa_and_the_generation_who_can_fix_it","recorded_at":"2014-10-22 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-10-21 14:58:36","updated_at":"2021-04-13
