{"talk":{"id":2541,"name":"Marwa Al-Sabouni: How Syria's architecture laid the foundation for brutal war","description":"What caused the war in Syria? Oppression, drought and religious differences all played key roles, but Marwa Al-Sabouni suggests another reason: architecture. Speaking to us over the Internet from Homs, where for the last six years she has watched the war tear her city apart, Al-Sabouni suggests that Syria's architecture divided its once tolerant and multicultural society into single-identity enclaves defined by class and religion. The country's future now depends on how it chooses to rebuild.","slug":"marwa_al_sabouni_how_syria_s_architecture_laid_the_foundation_for_brutal_war","recorded_at":"2016-06-26
