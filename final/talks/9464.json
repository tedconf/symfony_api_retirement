{"talk":{"id":9464,"name":"Amar Inamdar: The thrilling potential for off-grid solar energy","description":"There's an energy revolution happening in villages and towns across Africa -- off-grid solar energy is becoming a viable alternative to traditional electricity systems. In a bold talk about a true leapfrog moment, Amar Inamdar introduces us to proud owners of off-grid solar kits -- and explains how this technology has the opportunity to meet two extraordinary goals: energy access for all and a low-carbon future. \"Every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy,\" Inamdar says. \"That's the democracy of energy.\" (Followed by a brief Q&A with TED Curator Chris Anderson)","slug":"amar_inamdar_the_thrilling_potential_for_off_grid_solar_energy","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-26 15:57:43","updated_at":"2021-10-22
