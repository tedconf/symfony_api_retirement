{"talk":{"id":37760,"name":"Kashfia Rahman: How risk-taking changes a teenager's brain","description":"Why do teenagers sometimes make outrageous, risky choices? Do they suddenly become reckless, or are they just going through a natural phase? To find out, Kashfia Rahman -- winner of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (and a Harvard freshman) -- designed and conducted an experiment to test how high school students respond to and get used to risk, and how it changes their still-developing brains. What she discovered about risk and decision-making could change how we think about why teens do what they do.","slug":"kashfia_rahman_how_risk_taking_changes_a_teenager_s_brain","recorded_at":"2019-02-21 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-04-11 15:00:09","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:41:53","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":589,"name":"TED Salon U.S. Air Force"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7cff0569e539ff6f238b59fe72d47c205ee55302_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7cff0569e539ff6f238b59fe72d47c205ee55302_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7cff0569e539ff6f238b59fe72d47c205ee55302_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7cff0569e539ff6f238b59fe72d47c205ee55302_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ca57012029898de6650ea4c53d6e78471ac5e837_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5801738,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15987064,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28312041,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39892957,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53427539,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83789952,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":129702555,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6015944,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40058365,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83926263,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16240797,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KashfiaRahman_2019S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83929849,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"}},"tags":[{"tag":"brain"},{"tag":"decision-making"},{"tag":"neuroscience"},{"tag":"psychology"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"youth"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5120,"name":"Kashfia Rahman"}}],"ratings":[]}}
