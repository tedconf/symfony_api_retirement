{"talk":{"id":2614,"name":"Christopher Soghoian: Your smartphone is a civil rights issue","description":"The smartphone you use reflects more than just personal taste ... it could determine how closely you can be tracked, too. Privacy expert and TED Fellow Christopher Soghoian details a glaring difference between the encryption used on Apple and Android devices and urges us to pay attention to a growing digital security
