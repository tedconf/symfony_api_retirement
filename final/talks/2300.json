{"talk":{"id":2300,"name":"Alec Soth and Stacey Baker: This is what enduring love looks like","description":"Stacey Baker has always been obsessed with how couples meet. When she asked photographer Alec Soth to help her explore this topic, they found themselves at the world's largest speed-dating event, held in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day, and at the largest retirement community in Nevada \u2014 with Soth taking portraits of pairs in each locale. Between these two extremes, they unwound a beautiful through-line of how a couple goes from meeting to creating a life together. (This talk was part of a TED2015 session curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com or @popupmag on Twitter.)","slug":"alec_soth_and_stacey_baker_this_is_what_enduring_love_looks_like","recorded_at":"2015-03-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-07-15 14:49:51","updated_at":"2020-09-28
