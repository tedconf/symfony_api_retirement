{"talk":{"id":2471,"name":"Lisa Nip: How humans could evolve to survive in space","description":"If we hope to one day leave Earth and explore the universe, our bodies are going to have to get a lot better at surviving the harsh conditions of space. Using synthetic biology, Lisa Nip hopes to harness special powers from microbes on Earth -- such as the ability to withstand radiation -- to make humans more fit for exploring space. \"We're approaching a time during which we'll have the capacity to decide our own genetic destiny,\" Nip says. \"Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.\"","slug":"lisa_nip_how_humans_could_evolve_to_survive_in_space","recorded_at":"2015-11-14 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-03-30 15:15:09","updated_at":"2021-04-09
