{"talk":{"id":920,"name":"Dimitar Sasselov: How we found hundreds of potential Earth-like planets","description":"(NOTE: This talk was given in 2010, and this field of science has developed quickly since then. Read \"Criticisms & updates\" below for more details.) Astronomer Dimitar Sasselov and his colleagues search for Earth-like planets that may, someday, help us answer centuries-old questions about the origin and existence of biological life elsewhere (and on Earth). Preliminary results show that they have found 706 \"candidates\" -- some of which further research may prove to be planets with Earth-like geochemical characteristics.","slug":"dimitar_sasselov_how_we_found_hundreds_of_potential_earth_like_planets","recorded_at":"2010-07-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2010-07-21 09:10:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
