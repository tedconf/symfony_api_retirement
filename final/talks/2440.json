{"talk":{"id":2440,"name":"Raffaello D'Andrea: Meet the dazzling flying machines of the future","description":"When you hear the word \"drone,\" you probably think of something either very useful or very scary. But could they have aesthetic value?

Prepare to be dazzled by a dreamy, swirling array of flying machines as they dance like fireflies above the TED stage.","slug":"raffaello_d_andrea_meet_the_dazzling_flying_machines_of_the_future","recorded_at":"2016-02-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-02-19 16:03:22","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:45:50","viewed_count":5312787,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":377,"name":"TED2016"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b1d063df01db14ac64b3125f030027f114cf78ce_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b1d063df01db14ac64b3125f030027f114cf78ce_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b1d063df01db14ac64b3125f030027f114cf78ce_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b1d063df01db14ac64b3125f030027f114cf78ce_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6deb9d6006d9f495f7963cb4051a1e350ffb9ae6_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5741294,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15873207,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28139932,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39679475,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53124153,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83234369,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":128834980,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5874806,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39794663,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83226340,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16124984,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RaffaelloDAndrea_2016-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83226642,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"beauty"},{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"demo"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"drones"},{"tag":"flight"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"invention"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1594,"name":"Raffaello D'Andrea"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":478}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":683}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":375}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":287}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":327}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":331}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":26}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":101}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":28}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":27}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":8}}]}}
