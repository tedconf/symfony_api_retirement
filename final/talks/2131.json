{"talk":{"id":2131,"name":"Vincent Moon and Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos: Hidden music rituals around the world","description":"Vincent Moon travels the world with a backpack and a camera, filming astonishing music and ritual the world rarely sees -- from a powerful Sufi ritual in Chechnya to an ayahuasca journey in Peru. He hopes his films can help people see their own cultures in a new way, to make young people say: \"Whoa, my grandfather is as cool as Beyonc\u00e9.\" Followed by a mesmerizing performance by jazz icon Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos.","slug":"vincent_moon_and_nana_vasconcelos_hidden_music_rituals_around_the_world","recorded_at":"2014-10-09 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-11-14
