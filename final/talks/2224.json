{"talk":{"id":2224,"name":"Daniel Kish: How I use sonar to navigate the world","description":"Daniel Kish has been blind since he was 13 months old, but has learned to \"see\" using a form of echolocation. He clicks his tongue and sends out flashes of sound that bounce off surfaces in the environment and return to him, helping him to construct an understanding of the space around him. In a rousing talk, Kish shows how this works -- and asks us all to let go of our fear of the dark unknown.","slug":"daniel_kish_how_i_use_sonar_to_navigate_the_world","recorded_at":"2015-03-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-03-31 14:46:26","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:16:00","viewed_count":1308030,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":336,"name":"TED2015"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/974f8b1e115863c59ce549185eb7c0a8fa8375e7_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/974f8b1e115863c59ce549185eb7c0a8fa8375e7_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/974f8b1e115863c59ce549185eb7c0a8fa8375e7_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/974f8b1e115863c59ce549185eb7c0a8fa8375e7_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9d9e218a26b00bd5a0eb2f69f9a44e768fdebc26_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6449298,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17863865,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31635830,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44584741,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":59665190,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":93601791,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":145011420,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6582768,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44699930,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":93593599,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8160436,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18114754,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DanielKish_2015-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":93599370,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"disability"},{"tag":"fear"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":51,"name":"How We Learn"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2437,"name":"Daniel Kish"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":194}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":356}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":258}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":113}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":81}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":75}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":40}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":1}}]}}
