{"talk":{"id":20447,"name":"Will Marshall: The mission to create a searchable database of Earth's surface","description":"What if you could search the surface of the Earth the same way you search the internet? Will Marshall and his team at Planet use the world's largest fleet of satellites to image the entire Earth every day. Now they're moving on to a new project: using AI to index all the objects on the planet over time -- which could make ships, trees, houses and everything else on Earth searchable, the same way you search Google. He shares a vision for how this database can become a living record of the immense physical changes happening across the globe. \"You can't fix what you can't see,\" Marshall says. \"We want to give people the tools to see change and take action.\"","slug":"will_marshall_the_mission_to_create_a_searchable_database_of_earth_s_surface","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-07-16 15:01:36","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:40:26","viewed_count":1329566,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":494,"name":"TED2018"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e37182a52119aa52e1307364a522fa50c8637a1a_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e37182a52119aa52e1307364a522fa50c8637a1a_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e37182a52119aa52e1307364a522fa50c8637a1a_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e37182a52119aa52e1307364a522fa50c8637a1a_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/631afa7c7fd63d5e6eb290696cd87d20c716b3de_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3120402,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8575069,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15234908,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21557861,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28990617,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45351608,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":69454411,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3334500,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21723901,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45488318,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3812367,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8829790,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/WillMarshall_2018U-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45489511,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"photography"},{"tag":"space"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1772,"name":"Will Marshall"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":59}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":27}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":35}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":5}}]}}
