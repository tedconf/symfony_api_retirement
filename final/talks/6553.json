{"talk":{"id":6553,"name":"Heather Lanier: \"Good\" and \"bad\" are incomplete stories we tell ourselves","description":"Heather Lanier's daughter Fiona has Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, a genetic condition that results in developmental delays -- but that doesn't make her tragic, angelic or any of the other stereotypes about kids like her. In this talk about the beautiful, complicated, joyful and hard journey of raising a rare girl, Lanier questions our assumptions about what makes a life \"good\" or \"bad,\" challenging us to stop fixating on solutions for whatever we deem not normal, and instead to take life as it comes.","slug":"heather_lanier_good_and_bad_are_incomplete_stories_we_tell_ourselves","recorded_at":"2017-10-04
