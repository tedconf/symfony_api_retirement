{"talk":{"id":1078,"name":"Madeleine Albright: On being a woman and a diplomat","description":"Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talks bluntly about politics and diplomacy, making the case that women's issues deserve a place at the center of foreign policy. Far from being a \"soft\" issue, she says, women's issues are often the very hardest ones, dealing directly with life and death. A frank and funny Q&A with Pat Mitchell from the Paley Center.","slug":"madeleine_albright_on_being_a_woman_and_a_diplomat","recorded_at":"2010-12-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-02-18
