{"talk":{"id":2292,"name":"Dame Ellen MacArthur: The surprising thing I learned sailing solo around the world","description":"What do you learn when you sail around the world on your own? When solo sailor Ellen MacArthur circled the globe \u2013 carrying everything she needed with her \u2013 she came back with new insight into the way the world works, as a place of interlocking cycles and finite resources, where the decisions we make today affect what's left for tomorrow. She proposes a bold new way to see the world's economic systems: not as linear, but as circular, where everything comes around.","slug":"dame_ellen_macarthur_the_surprising_thing_i_learned_sailing_solo_around_the_world","recorded_at":"2015-03-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-06-29 15:19:02","updated_at":"2021-04-09
