{"talk":{"id":31459,"name":"Casey Gerald: Embrace your raw, strange magic","description":"The way we're taught to live has got to change, says author Casey Gerald. Too often, we hide parts of ourselves in order to fit in, win praise, be accepted. But at what cost? In this inspiring talk, Gerald shares the personal sacrifices he made to attain success in the upper echelons of American society -- and shows why it's time for us to have the courage to live in the raw, strange magic of ourselves.","slug":"casey_gerald_embrace_your_raw_strange_magic","recorded_at":"2018-12-11 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-01-17 21:45:04","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:42:17","viewed_count":1095315,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":656,"name":"TED Salon Belonging"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4b424d16001e681464c6ebe8bcb4109db12f92dd_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4b424d16001e681464c6ebe8bcb4109db12f92dd_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4b424d16001e681464c6ebe8bcb4109db12f92dd_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4b424d16001e681464c6ebe8bcb4109db12f92dd_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d86236a60742f51ccb2237bc4dcc8ca16063b96f_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8410329,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23348028,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41323500,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58182888,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77757191,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":122144883,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":189478399,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8624642,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58348774,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":122281478,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10333047,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23606290,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CaseyGerald_2018S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":122299726,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"LGBTQIA+"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"identity"},{"tag":"personal growth"},{"tag":"race"},{"tag":"self"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"writing"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2880,"name":"Casey Gerald"}}],"ratings":[]}}
