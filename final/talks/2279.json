{"talk":{"id":2279,"name":"Rana el Kaliouby: This app knows how you feel -- from the look on your face","description":"Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives -- how we learn, how we communicate, how we make decisions. Yet they're absent from our digital lives; the devices and apps we interact with have no way of knowing how we feel. Scientist\u00a0Rana el Kaliouby\u00a0aims to change that. She demos a powerful new technology that reads your facial expressions and matches them to corresponding emotions.\u00a0This\u00a0\"emotion engine\"\u00a0has big implications, she says, and could change not just how we interact with machines -- but with each other.","slug":"rana_el_kaliouby_this_app_knows_how_you_feel_from_the_look_on_your_face","recorded_at":"2015-05-28
