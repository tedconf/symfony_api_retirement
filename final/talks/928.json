{"talk":{"id":928,"name":"Lewis Pugh: My mind-shifting Everest swim","description":"After he swam the North Pole, Lewis Pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip. Then he heard of Lake Imja in the Himalayas, created by recent glacial melting, and Lake Pumori, a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on Everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change.","slug":"lewis_pugh_my_mind_shifting_everest_swim","recorded_at":"2010-07-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2010-07-30
