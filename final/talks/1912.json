{"talk":{"id":1912,"name":"Joe Kowan: How I beat stage fright","description":"Humanity's fine-tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species, giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts. But it's less wonderful when that same visceral, body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at a Tuesday night open-mic. Palms sweat, hands shake, vision blurs, and the brain says RUN: it's stage fright. In this charming, tuneful little talk, Joe Kowan talks about how he conquered it.","slug":"joe_kowan_how_i_beat_stage_fright","recorded_at":"2013-11-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-01-24
