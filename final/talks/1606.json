{"talk":{"id":1606,"name":"Adam Garone: Healthier men, one moustache at a time","description":"Adam Garone has an impressive moustache, and it's for a good cause. A co-founder of Movember, Garone's initiative to raise awareness for men's health -- by having men grow out their moustaches every November -- began as a dare in a bar in 2003.
