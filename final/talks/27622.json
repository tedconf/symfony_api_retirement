{"talk":{"id":27622,"name":"Chieh Huang: Confessions of a recovering micromanager","description":"Think about the most tired you've ever been at work. It probably wasn't when you stayed late or came home from a road trip -- chances are it was when you had someone looking over your shoulder, watching your each and every move. \"If we know that micromanagement isn't really effective, why do we do it?\" asks entrepreneur Chieh Huang. In a funny talk packed with wisdom and humility, Huang shares the cure for micromanagement madness -- and how to foster innovation and happiness at work.","slug":"chieh_huang_confessions_of_a_recovering_micromanager","recorded_at":"2018-10-03 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-12-03 15:51:51","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:27:57","viewed_count":1470320,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":562,"name":"TED@BCG Toronto"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/46983a7d2e209ae49ce220057fbd34cac3b1a18c_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/46983a7d2e209ae49ce220057fbd34cac3b1a18c_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/46983a7d2e209ae49ce220057fbd34cac3b1a18c_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/46983a7d2e209ae49ce220057fbd34cac3b1a18c_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/92d5efd9fe78e9b3be936fecbfe0f7ad2ef2b08b_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6000781,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16600828,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":29400956,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41433688,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55478135,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87041050,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":134745735,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6215046,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41599613,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87177622,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7380948,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16858649,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChiehHuang_2018S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87183403,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"happiness"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"motivation"},{"tag":"personal growth"},{"tag":"potential"},{"tag":"success"},{"tag":"trust"},{"tag":"work"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4809,"name":"Chieh Huang"}}],"ratings":[]}}
