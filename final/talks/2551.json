{"talk":{"id":2551,"name":"Emma Marris: Nature is everywhere -- we just need to learn to see it","description":"How do you define \"nature?\" If we define it as that which is untouched by humans, then we won't have any left, says environmental writer Emma Marris. She urges us to consider a new definition of nature -- one that includes not only pristine wilderness but also the untended patches of plants growing in urban spaces -- and encourages us to bring our children out to touch and tinker with it, so that one day they might love and protect it.","slug":"emma_marris_nature_is_everywhere_we_just_need_to_learn_to_see_it","recorded_at":"2016-06-26
