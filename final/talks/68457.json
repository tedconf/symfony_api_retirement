{"talk":{"id":68457,"name":"Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: How to be fearless in the face of authoritarianism","description":"How do you stand up to authoritarianism? And what does it mean to be \"fearless\"? In this powerful talk, housewife-turned-politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya describes her unlikely bid to defeat Belarus's long-time autocratic leader in the nation's 2020 presidential election. Painting a vivid picture of how small acts of defiance flourished into massive, peaceful demonstrations, she shares a beautiful meditation on the link between fearlessness and freedom, reminding us that we all have what it takes to stand up to injustice -- we just need to do it together.","slug":"sviatlana_tsikhanouskaya_how_to_be_fearless_in_the_face_of_authoritarianism","recorded_at":"2020-11-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-11-12 16:06:55","updated_at":"2021-10-22 20:58:22","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":659,"name":"TEDWomen 2020"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f959ddf79cbac8e99fb6131f38518dfd797ab505_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f959ddf79cbac8e99fb6131f38518dfd797ab505_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f959ddf79cbac8e99fb6131f38518dfd797ab505_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f959ddf79cbac8e99fb6131f38518dfd797ab505_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/64abcadf5a1e206c72cc267e03bc2d1acbc606c2_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":2859654,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7841770,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13898994,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19606653,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26220876,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40584772,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62295286,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3118156,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20125552,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40861542,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya_2020W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3755687,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"be":{"name":"Belarusian"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"gl":{"name":"Galician"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"democracy"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"politics"},{"tag":"protest"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6175,"name":"Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya"}}],"ratings":[]}}
