{"talk":{"id":2416,"name":"Tania Simoncelli: Should you be able to patent a human gene?","description":"A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable -- which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court.","slug":"tania_simoncelli_should_you_be_able_to_patent_a_human_gene","recorded_at":"2014-11-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-01-27 15:35:20","updated_at":"2021-04-09
