\u2014 small loans to small entrepreneurs -- is the best way to drive growth in developing countries. \"We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor person in Africa is an entrepreneur,\u201d he says. \"Yet, my work has taught me that most people want jobs.\u201d Delle, a TED Fellow, makes the case for supporting large companies and factories \u2014 and clearing away
