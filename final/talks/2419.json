{"talk":{"id":2419,"name":"Auke Ijspeert: A robot that runs and swims like a salamander","description":"Roboticist Auke Ijspeert designs biorobots, machines modeled after real animals that are capable of handling complex terrain and would appear at home in the pages of a sci-fi novel. The process of creating these robots leads to better automata that can be used for fieldwork, service, and search and rescue. But these robots don't just mimic the natural world -- they help us understand our own biology better, unlocking previously unknown secrets of the spinal cord.","slug":"auke_ijspeert_a_robot_that_runs_and_swims_like_a_salamander","recorded_at":"2015-12-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-01-28 16:37:23","updated_at":"2021-04-09
