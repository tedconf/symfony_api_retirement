{"talk":{"id":2287,"name":"Chip Kidd: The art of first impressions -- in design and life","description":"Book designer Chip Kidd knows all too well how often we judge things by first appearances. In this hilarious, fast-paced talk, he explains the two techniques designers use to communicate instantly -- clarity and mystery -- and when, why and how they work. He celebrates beautiful, useful pieces of design, skewers less successful work, and shares the thinking behind some of his own iconic book covers.","slug":"chip_kidd_the_art_of_first_impressions_in_design_and_life","recorded_at":"2015-05-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-06-23 14:59:40","updated_at":"2021-04-13
