{"talk":{"id":2523,"name":"Sajay Samuel: How college loans exploit students for profit","description":"\"Once upon a time in America,\" says professor Sajay Samuel, \"going to college did not mean graduating with debt.\" Today, higher education has become a consumer product -- costs have skyrocketed, saddling students with a combined debt of over $1 trillion, while universities and loan companies make massive profits. Samuel proposes a radical solution: link tuition costs to a degree's expected earnings, so that students can make informed decisions about their future, restore their love of learning and contribute to the world in a meaningful way.","slug":"sajay_samuel_how_college_loans_exploit_students_for_profit","recorded_at":"2016-02-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-06-09 15:17:02","updated_at":"2021-04-09
