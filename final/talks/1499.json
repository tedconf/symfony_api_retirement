{"talk":{"id":1499,"name":"Cesar Harada: A novel idea for cleaning up oil spills","description":"When TED Senior Fellow Cesar Harada heard about the devastating effects of the BP Oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, he quit his dream job and moved to New Orleans to develop a more efficient way to soak up the oil. He designed a highly maneuverable, flexible boat capable of cleaning large tracts quickly. But rather than turn a profit, he has opted to open-source the design.","slug":"cesar_harada_a_novel_idea_for_cleaning_up_oil_spills","recorded_at":"2012-06-25 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-07-05 14:57:06","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:43:49","viewed_count":879208,"emailed_count":60,"event":{"id":222,"name":"TEDxSummit"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/12d4ac338b7ed4b2b2f5d231ba4cada1bc2d57d3_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/12d4ac338b7ed4b2b2f5d231ba4cada1bc2d57d3_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/12d4ac338b7ed4b2b2f5d231ba4cada1bc2d57d3_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"800x600","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/12d4ac338b7ed4b2b2f5d231ba4cada1bc2d57d3_800x600.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7141101,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19820696,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35010319,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49113164,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65699459,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103300548,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":160492130,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7245933,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49381638,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103536412,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8767006,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19916620,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CesarHarada_2012S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103516818,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"ocean"},{"tag":"software"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":14,"name":"Inspired by Nature"}},{"theme":{"id":15,"name":"A Greener Future?"}},{"theme":{"id":66,"name":"Ocean Wonders"}},{"theme":{"id":77,"name":"Talks from TED Fellows"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1384,"name":"Cesar Harada"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":208}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":417}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":357}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":77}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":77}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":104}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":38}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":74}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":7}}]}}
