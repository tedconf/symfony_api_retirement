{"talk":{"id":63401,"name":"Cheryl Holder: The link between climate change, health and poverty","description":"For the poor and vulnerable, the health impacts of climate change are already here, says physician Cheryl Holder. Unseasonably hot temperatures, disease-carrying mosquitoes and climate gentrification threaten those with existing health conditions, while wealthier people move to higher ground. In an impassioned talk, Holder proposes impactful ways clinicians can protect their patients from climate-related health challenges -- and calls on doctors, politicians and others to build a care system that incorporates economic and social justice.","slug":"cheryl_holder_the_link_between_climate_change_health_and_poverty","recorded_at":"2020-03-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-06-03 14:51:31","updated_at":"2020-11-10 03:40:25","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":643,"name":"TEDMED 2020"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/655bee797ee5abe685121218a74505f2d3d65220_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/655bee797ee5abe685121218a74505f2d3d65220_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/655bee797ee5abe685121218a74505f2d3d65220_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/655bee797ee5abe685121218a74505f2d3d65220_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/064a1ac6350fbdf85299084848e5c3b6db8dfb5e_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6033740,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16709885,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":29552389,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41563924,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55471739,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87737338,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":135434617,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6167686,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41897449,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87966310,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16963091,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CherylHolder_2020P-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87999608,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"gl":{"name":"Galician"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDMED"},{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"health care"},{"tag":"human rights"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"poverty"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5867,"name":"Cheryl Holder"}}],"ratings":[]}}
