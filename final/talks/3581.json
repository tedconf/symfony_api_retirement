{"talk":{"id":3581,"name":"G.T. Bynum: A Republican mayor's plan to replace partisanship with policy","description":"Conventional wisdom says that to win an election, you need to play to your constituencies' basest, most divisive instincts. But as a candidate for mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, G.T. Bynum decided to skip the smear campaigns, tell voters what he wanted to accomplish and give them ways to measure his success -- and it led him to win the election. In a hopeful, funny talk, Bynum shares how he's tackling his city's most pressing issues and says that we need to set aside philosophical disagreements and focus on the aspirations that unite us.","slug":"g_t_bynum_a_republican_mayor_s_plan_to_replace_partisanship_with_policy","recorded_at":"2017-02-09 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-11-30 21:00:33","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:44:27","viewed_count":935882,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":461,"name":"TEDxPennsylvaniaAvenue"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d23acd07172ea13e73a263475b8b24fdafe516a2_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d23acd07172ea13e73a263475b8b24fdafe516a2_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d23acd07172ea13e73a263475b8b24fdafe516a2_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d23acd07172ea13e73a263475b8b24fdafe516a2_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7db5bb5f8ff1e5681501a8a26924a3e6eb46f8fe_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6689338,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18548418,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32822495,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46155095,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":61569549,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":95137178,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":147766696,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6948278,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46674172,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":95413900,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8250299,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18803038,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GTBynum_2017X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":95424055,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"collaboration"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"data"},{"tag":"democracy"},{"tag":"government"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"politics"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3689,"name":"G.T.
