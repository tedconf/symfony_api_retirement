{"talk":{"id":52062,"name":"Erika Pinheiro: What's really happening at the US-Mexico border -- and how we can do better","description":"At the US-Mexico border, policies of prolonged detention and family separation have made seeking asylum in the United States difficult and dangerous. In this raw and heartfelt talk, immigration attorney Erika Pinheiro offers a glimpse into her daily work on both sides of the border and shares some of the stories behind the statistics -- including her own story of being detained and separated from her son. It's a clear-eyed call to remember the humanity that's impacted by policy -- and a warning: \"History shows us that the first population to be vilified and stripped of their rights is rarely the last,\" she says.","slug":"erika_pinheiro_what_s_really_happening_at_the_us_mexico_border_and_how_we_can_do_better","recorded_at":"2019-09-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-11-14 15:57:22","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:40:50","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":621,"name":"TED Salon Border Stories"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1b6f1688cefd1b95ee29282b4d71386e75c7e717_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1b6f1688cefd1b95ee29282b4d71386e75c7e717_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1b6f1688cefd1b95ee29282b4d71386e75c7e717_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1b6f1688cefd1b95ee29282b4d71386e75c7e717_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/67a96282bdb90dc0014eb6165c69ffbc76d5e77b_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6934758,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19213730,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34007238,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47914771,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":64109349,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":100680923,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":156013698,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7149033,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48080679,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":100817535,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8543400,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19475587,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ErikaPinheiro_2019S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":100807962,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"gu":{"name":"Gujarati"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"government"},{"tag":"immigration"},{"tag":"justice system"},{"tag":"law"},{"tag":"policy"},{"tag":"refugees"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5487,"name":"Erika Pinheiro"}}],"ratings":[]}}
