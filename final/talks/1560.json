{"talk":{"id":1560,"name":"Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong","description":"Scott Fraser studies how humans remember crimes -- and bear witness to them. In this powerful talk, which focuses on a deadly shooting at sunset, he suggests that even close-up eyewitnesses to a crime can create \"memories\" they could not have seen. Why? Because the brain abhors a vacuum. Editor's note: In the original version of this talk, Scott Fraser misspoke about available footage of Two World Trade Center (Tower 2). The misstatement has been edited out for clarity.","slug":"scott_fraser_why_eyewitnesses_get_it_wrong","recorded_at":"2012-05-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-09-10 14:59:22","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:14:24","viewed_count":1213270,"emailed_count":105,"event":{"id":40,"name":"TEDxUSC"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/650623dba1696ad755b8a729dc55e7e152a6b896_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/650623dba1696ad755b8a729dc55e7e152a6b896_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/650623dba1696ad755b8a729dc55e7e152a6b896_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"800x600","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/650623dba1696ad755b8a729dc55e7e152a6b896_800x600.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9031877,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25076599,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44339968,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62328978,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":83087201,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":131268806,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":203534813,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9164610,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62738309,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":131231463,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25304596,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ScottFraser_2012X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":131243573,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"ka":{"name":"Georgian"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"mk":{"name":"Macedonian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"brain"},{"tag":"cognitive science"},{"tag":"crime"},{"tag":"forensics"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"government"},{"tag":"law"},{"tag":"memory"},{"tag":"neuroscience"},{"tag":"prison"},{"tag":"psychology"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"sight"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":4,"name":"How the Mind Works"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1412,"name":"Scott Fraser"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":246}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":282}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":336}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":65}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":78}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":39}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":58}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":60}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":33}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":25}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":17}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":9}}]}}
