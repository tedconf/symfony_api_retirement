{"talk":{"id":19413,"name":"Paul Rucker: The symbols of systemic racism -- and how to take away their power","description":"Multidisciplinary artist and TED Fellow Paul Rucker is unstitching the legacy of systemic racism in the United States. A collector of artifacts connected to the history of slavery -- from branding irons and shackles to postcards depicting lynchings -- Rucker couldn't find an undamaged Ku Klux Klan robe for his collection, so he began making his own. The result: striking garments in non-traditional fabrics like kente cloth, camouflage and silk that confront the normalization of systemic racism in the US. \"If we as a people collectively look at these objects and realize that they are part of our history, we can find a way to where they have no more power over us,\" Rucker says.
