{"talk":{"id":13828,"name":"Priya Vulchi and Winona Guo: What it takes to be racially literate","description":"Over the last year, Priya Vulchi and Winona Guo traveled to all 50 US states, collecting personal stories about race and intersectionality. Now they're on a mission to equip every American with the tools to understand, navigate and improve a world structured by racial division. In a dynamic talk, Vulchi and Guo pair the personal stories they've collected with research and statistics to reveal two fundamental gaps in our racial literacy -- and how we can overcome them.","slug":"priya_vulchi_and_winona_guo_what_it_takes_to_be_racially_literate","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-05-07 14:53:31","updated_at":"2021-10-29
