{"talk":{"id":10835,"name":"Shameem Akhtar: To learn is to be free","description":"Shameem Akhtar posed as a boy during her early childhood in Pakistan so she could enjoy the privileges Pakistani girls are rarely afforded: to play outside and attend school. In an eye-opening, personal talk, Akhtar recounts how the opportunity to get an education altered the course of her life -- and ultimately changed the culture of her village, where today every young girl goes to school.","slug":"shameem_akhtar_to_learn_is_to_be_free","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-01 21:00:10","updated_at":"2021-05-21
