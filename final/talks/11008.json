{"talk":{"id":11008,"name":"Raymond Tang: Be humble -- and other lessons from the philosophy of water","description":"How do we find fulfillment in a world that's constantly changing? Raymond Tang struggled with this question until he came across the ancient Chinese philosophy of the Tao Te Ching. In it, he found a passage comparing goodness to water, an idea he's now applying to his everyday life. In this charming talk, he shares three lessons he's learned so far from the \"philosophy of water.\" \"What would water do?\" Tang asks. \"This simple and powerful question ... has changed my life for the better.\"","slug":"raymond_tang_be_humble_and_other_lessons_from_the_philosophy_of_water","recorded_at":"2017-12-11 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-02-27 15:42:28","updated_at":"2021-10-23
