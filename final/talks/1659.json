{"talk":{"id":1659,"name":"Zahra' Langhi: Why Libya's revolution didn't work -- and what might","description":"In Libya, Zahra' Langhi was part of the \"days of rage\" movement that helped topple the dictator Gaddafi. But -- then what? In their first elections, Libyans tried an innovative slate of candidates, the \"zipper ballot,\" that ensured equal representation from men and women of both sides. Yet the same gridlocked politics of dominance and exclusion won out. What Libya needs now, Langhi suggests, is collaboration, not competition; compassion, not rage.","slug":"zahra_langhi_why_libya_s_revolution_didn_t_work_and_what_might","recorded_at":"2012-12-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-02-04 16:20:41","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:46:57","viewed_count":539136,"emailed_count":14,"event":{"id":258,"name":"TEDxWomen 2012"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/0efb7be6d24022335aa24aa1dd5f83896805f6a9_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/0efb7be6d24022335aa24aa1dd5f83896805f6a9_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/0efb7be6d24022335aa24aa1dd5f83896805f6a9_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"1600x1200","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/0efb7be6d24022335aa24aa1dd5f83896805f6a9_1600x1200.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4801588,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13255235,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23450816,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32994459,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44064818,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":68173411,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":105734196,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4934213,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33403987,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67195941,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6013176,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":68172294,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ZahraLanghi_2012X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13486397,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"ur":{"name":"Urdu"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"compassion"},{"tag":"democracy"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"politics"},{"tag":"women"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":71,"name":"Women Reshaping the World"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1533,"name":"Zahra' Langhi"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":44}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":51}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":33}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":107}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":84}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":32}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":20}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":3}}]}}
