{"talk":{"id":2565,"name":"Timothy Ihrig: What we can do to die well","description":"The healthcare industry in America is so focused on pathology, surgery and pharmacology -- on what doctors \"do\" to patients -- that it often overlooks the values of the human beings it's supposed to care for. Palliative care physician Timothy Ihrig explains the benefits of a different approach, one that fosters a patient's overall quality of life and navigates serious illness from diagnosis to death with dignity and compassion.","slug":"timothy_ihrig_what_we_can_do_to_die_well","recorded_at":"2013-09-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-08-23 15:04:39","updated_at":"2021-04-09
