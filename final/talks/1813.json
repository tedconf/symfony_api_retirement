{"talk":{"id":1813,"name":"Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu: A mouse. A laser beam. A manipulated memory.","description":"Can we edit the content of our memories? It's a sci-fi-tinged question that Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu are asking in their lab at MIT. Essentially, the pair shoot a laser beam into the brain of a living mouse to activate and manipulate its memory.
