{"talk":{"id":50959,"name":"Sara-Jane Dunn: The next software revolution: programming biological cells","description":"The cells in your body are like computer software: they're \"programmed\" to carry out specific functions at specific times. If we can better understand this process, we could unlock the ability to reprogram cells ourselves, says computational biologist Sara-Jane Dunn. In a talk from the cutting-edge of science, she explains how her team is studying embryonic stem cells to gain a new understanding of the biological programs that power life -- and develop \"living software\" that could transform medicine, agriculture and energy.","slug":"sara_jane_dunn_the_next_software_revolution_programming_biological_cells","recorded_at":"2019-07-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-11-01 19:46:22","updated_at":"2020-12-24 17:14:59","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":603,"name":"TEDSummit 2019"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6d2b6e00eebdc87df2427ebdc84baf302a1707c9_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6d2b6e00eebdc87df2427ebdc84baf302a1707c9_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6d2b6e00eebdc87df2427ebdc84baf302a1707c9_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6d2b6e00eebdc87df2427ebdc84baf302a1707c9_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b5802743600f62c436044d931381213d76b837d4_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7308675,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20251201,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35889608,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50501854,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67536710,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":106001369,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":164215848,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7573846,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50857888,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":106561870,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9005510,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20518284,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SaraJaneDunn_2019T-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":106574316,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"gu":{"name":"Gujarati"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"DNA"},{"tag":"biology"},{"tag":"biotech"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"genetics"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"medical research"},{"tag":"medicine"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"synthetic biology"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5404,"name":"Sara-Jane Dunn"}}],"ratings":[]}}
