{"talk":{"id":41570,"name":"Bruce Friedrich: The next global agricultural revolution","description":"Conventional meat production causes harm to our environment and presents risks to global health, but people aren't going to eat less meat unless we give them alternatives that cost the same (or less) and that taste the same (or better). In an eye-opening talk, food innovator and TED Fellow Bruce Friedrich shows the plant- and cell-based products that could soon transform the global meat industry -- and your dinner plate.","slug":"bruce_friedrich_the_next_global_agricultural_revolution","recorded_at":"2019-04-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-05-21 19:56:50","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:40:45","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":597,"name":"TED2019"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/16a7077940b244e8b0ec12785505dd88d5fb6a1c_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/16a7077940b244e8b0ec12785505dd88d5fb6a1c_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/16a7077940b244e8b0ec12785505dd88d5fb6a1c_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/16a7077940b244e8b0ec12785505dd88d5fb6a1c_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/02a56c6a0892022fee6841951583469cebd01b9a_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":2904764,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7974375,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14145941,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20015208,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26946918,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42070511,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":64488095,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3119100,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20181054,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42207084,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3441691,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8232744,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BruceFriedrich_2019U-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42208755,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ku":{"name":"Kurdish"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"lt":{"name":"Lithuanian"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sw":{"name":"Swahili"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"agriculture"},{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"food"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"sustainability"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5199,"name":"Bruce Friedrich"}}],"ratings":[]}}
