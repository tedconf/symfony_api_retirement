{"talk":{"id":2543,"name":"Alexander Betts: Why Brexit happened -- and what to do next","description":"We are embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are, and Brexit grew out of a deep, unexamined divide between those that fear globalization and those that embrace it, says social scientist Alexander Betts. How do we now address that fear as well as growing disillusionment with the political establishment, while refusing to give in to xenophobia and nationalism? Join Betts as he discusses four post-Brexit steps toward a more inclusive world.","slug":"alexander_betts_why_brexit_happened_and_what_to_do_next","recorded_at":"2016-06-29
