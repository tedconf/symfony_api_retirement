{"talk":{"id":2889,"name":"Nikki Webber Allen: Don't suffer from your depression in silence","description":"Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness -- they mean we're human, says producer and activist Nikki Webber Allen. Even after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, Webber Allen felt too ashamed to tell anybody, keeping her condition a secret until a family tragedy revealed how others close to her were also suffering. In this important talk about mental health, she speaks openly about her struggle -- and why communities of color must undo the stigma that misreads depression as a weakness and keeps sufferers from getting help.","slug":"nikki_webber_allen_don_t_suffer_from_your_depression_in_silence","recorded_at":"2017-06-06 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-10-05 14:59:04","updated_at":"2020-11-09
