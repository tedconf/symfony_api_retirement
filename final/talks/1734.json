{"talk":{"id":1734,"name":"Pearl Arredondo: My story, from gangland daughter to star teacher","description":"Pearl Arredondo grew up in East Los Angeles, the daughter of a high-ranking gang member who was in and out of jail. Many teachers wrote her off as having a problem with authority. Now a teacher herself, she's creating a different kind of school and telling students her story so that they know it's okay if sometimes homework isn't the first thing on their minds.","slug":"pearl_arredondo_my_story_from_gangland_daughter_to_star_teacher","recorded_at":"2013-05-07 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-05-08 15:05:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
