{"talk":{"id":2338,"name":"Martin Pistorius: How my mind came back to life \u2014 and no one knew","description":"Imagine being unable to say, \"I am hungry,\" \"I am in pain,\" \"thank you,\" or \"I love you,\u201d -- losing your ability to communicate, being trapped inside your body, surrounded by people yet utterly alone. For 13 long years, that was Martin Pistorius\u2019s reality. After contracting a brain infection at the age of twelve, Pistorius lost his ability to control his movements and to speak, and eventually he failed every test for mental awareness. He had become a ghost. But then a strange thing started to happen -- his mind began to knit itself back together. In this moving talk, Pistorius tells how he freed himself from a life locked inside his own body.","slug":"martin_pistorius_how_my_mind_came_back_to_life_and_no_one_knew","recorded_at":"2015-08-29
