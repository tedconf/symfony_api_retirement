{"talk":{"id":1965,"name":"Christopher Emdin: Teach teachers how to create magic","description":"What do rap shows, barbershop banter and Sunday services have in common? As Christopher Emdin says, they all hold the secret magic to enthrall and teach at the same time \u2014 and it's a skill we often don't teach to educators. A longtime teacher himself, now a science advocate and cofounder of Science Genius B.A.T.T.L.E.S. with the GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, Emdin offers a vision to make the classroom come alive.","slug":"christopher_emdin_teach_teachers_how_to_create_magic","recorded_at":"2013-10-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-04-08 15:14:02","updated_at":"2021-04-13
