{"talk":{"id":17922,"name":"John Doerr: Why the secret to success is setting the right goals","description":"Our leaders and institutions are failing us, but it's not always because they're bad or unethical, says venture capitalist John Doerr -- often, it's simply because they're leading us toward the wrong objectives. In this practical talk, Doerr shows us how we can get back on track with \"Objectives and Key Results,\" or OKRs -- a goal-setting system that's been employed by the likes of Google, Intel and Bono to set and execute on audacious goals. Learn more about how setting the right goals can mean the difference between success and failure -- and how we can use OKRs to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable.","slug":"john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-06-11 14:57:44","updated_at":"2021-04-13
