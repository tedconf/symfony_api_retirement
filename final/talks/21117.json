{"talk":{"id":21117,"name":"Stephen DeBerry: Why the \"wrong side of the tracks\" is usually the east side of cities","description":"What do communities on the social, economic and environmental margins have in common? For one thing, they tend to be on the east sides of cities. In this short talk about a surprising insight, anthropologist and venture capitalist Stephen DeBerry explains how both environmental and man-made factors have led to disparity by design in cities from East Palo Alto, California to East Jerusalem and beyond -- and suggests some elegant solutions to fix it.","slug":"stephen_deberry_why_the_wrong_side_of_the_tracks_is_usually_the_east_side_of_cities","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-08-21 14:50:20","updated_at":"2021-04-09
