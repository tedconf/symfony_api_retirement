{"talk":{"id":72829,"name":"Greg Anderson: Why there's no such thing as objective reality","description":"In the grand scheme of history, modern reality is a bizarre exception when compared to the worlds of ancient, precolonial and Indigenous civilizations, where myths ruled and gods roamed, says historian Greg Anderson. So why do Westerners today think they're right about reality and everybody else is wrong? Anderson tears into the fabric of objective reality to reveal the many universes that lie beyond -- and encourages a healthy reimagining of what other possible ways of being human could look like.","slug":"greg_anderson_why_there_s_no_such_thing_as_objective_reality","recorded_at":"2020-02-22 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-02-23 16:05:50","updated_at":"2021-10-18 06:27:06","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":481,"name":"TEDxOhioStateUniversity"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c75d0e6910c64af79efa62a96429f72772015996_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c75d0e6910c64af79efa62a96429f72772015996_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c75d0e6910c64af79efa62a96429f72772015996_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c75d0e6910c64af79efa62a96429f72772015996_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e00a3ed70af8bb95f4899b9920605889cffd7244_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8041707,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22315163,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39463524,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55455010,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":73964803,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":114636043,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":178637448,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8300206,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55974237,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":114912788,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10045700,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22576139,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/GregAnderson_2020X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":114910138,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"ancient world"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"philosophy"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"universe"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6265,"name":"Greg Anderson"}}],"ratings":[]}}
