{"talk":{"id":4366,"name":"Teresa Njoroge: What I learned serving time for a crime I didn't commit","description":"In 2011, Teresa Njoroge was convicted of a financial crime she didn't commit -- the result of a long string of false accusations, increasing bribe attempts and the corrupt justice system in her home in Kenya. Once incarcerated, she discovered that most of the women and girls locked up with her were also victims of the same broken system, caught in a revolving door of life in and out of prison due to poor education and lack of economic opportunity. Now free and cleared by the courts of appeal, Njoroge shares how she's giving women in prison the skills, tools and support they need to break the cycle of poverty and crime and build a better life.","slug":"teresa_njoroge_what_i_learned_serving_time_for_a_crime_i_didn_t_commit","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-11-13 15:52:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
