{"talk":{"id":2433,"name":"Ivan Coyote: Why we need gender-neutral bathrooms","description":"There are a few things that we all need: fresh air, water, food, shelter, love ... and a safe place to pee. For trans people who don't fit neatly into the gender binary, public restrooms are a major source of anxiety and the place where they are most likely to be questioned or harassed. In this poetically rhythmic talk, Ivan Coyote grapples with complex and intensely personal issues of gender identity and highlights the need for gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.","slug":"ivan_coyote_why_we_need_gender_neutral_bathrooms","recorded_at":"2015-11-14 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-02-26 15:28:32","updated_at":"2021-04-09
