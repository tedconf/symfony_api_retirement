{"talk":{"id":2706,"name":"Jude Kelly: Why women should tell the stories of humanity","description":"For many centuries (and for many reasons) critically acclaimed creative genius has generally come from a male perspective. As theater director Jude Kelly points out in this passionately reasoned talk, that skew affects how we interpret even non-fictional women's stories and rights. She thinks there's a more useful, more inclusive way to look at the world, and she calls on artists -- women and men -- to paint, draw, write about, film and imagine a gender-equal society.","slug":"jude_kelly_why_women_should_tell_the_stories_of_humanity","recorded_at":"2016-10-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-03-08 15:53:57","updated_at":"2021-04-09
