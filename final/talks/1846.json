{"talk":{"id":1846,"name":"Iwan Baan: Ingenious homes in unexpected places","description":"In the center of Caracas, Venezuela, stands the 45-story \"Tower of David,\" an unfinished, abandoned skyscraper. But about eight years ago, people started moving in. Photographer Iwan Baan shows how people build homes in unlikely places, touring us through the family apartments of Torre David, a city on the water in Nigeria, and an underground village in China. Glorious images celebrate humanity's ability to survive and make a home -- anywhere.","slug":"iwan_baan_ingenious_homes_in_unexpected_places","recorded_at":"2013-09-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-10-16 15:15:02","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:50:52","viewed_count":1553548,"emailed_count":440,"event":{"id":294,"name":"TEDCity2.0"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/167f6a84f1e15eb73f7df4987097a42268230193_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/167f6a84f1e15eb73f7df4987097a42268230193_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/167f6a84f1e15eb73f7df4987097a42268230193_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"1600x1200","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/167f6a84f1e15eb73f7df4987097a42268230193_1600x1200.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8344462,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23188486,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41048743,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":57719884,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":76948003,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":121516416,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":188025485,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8400416,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":57870775,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":121894894,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10489259,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23413457,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IwanBaan_2013Z-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":121473202,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"ca":{"name":"Catalan"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"et":{"name":"Estonian"},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"cities"},{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"photography"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":10,"name":"Architectural Inspiration"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1692,"name":"Iwan Baan"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":573}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":187}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":227}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":312}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":37}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":13}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":289}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":136}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":35}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":46}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":4}}]}}
