{"talk":{"id":2020,"name":"Uri Alon: Why science demands a leap into the unknown","description":"While studying for his PhD in physics, Uri Alon thought he was a failure because all his research paths led to dead ends. But, with the help of improv theater, he came to realize that there could be joy in getting lost. A call for scientists to stop thinking of research as a direct line from question to answer, but as something more creative. It's a message that will resonate, no matter what your field.","slug":"uri_alon_why_science_demands_a_leap_into_the_unknown","recorded_at":"2013-06-13 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-06-12 15:05:26","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:16:33","viewed_count":1092869,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":241,"name":"TEDGlobal 2013"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cf7d29a98470c8576d76fb122b9433596d3495b8_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cf7d29a98470c8576d76fb122b9433596d3495b8_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cf7d29a98470c8576d76fb122b9433596d3495b8_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cf7d29a98470c8576d76fb122b9433596d3495b8_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7803516,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21630031,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38335594,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53955477,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72122275,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":110870175,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":172983813,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7940862,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":54243160,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111281272,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9789436,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21889703,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2013G-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111284233,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"da":{"name":"Danish"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"medical research"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"teaching"},{"tag":"theater"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":32,"name":"Unconventional Explanations"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1615,"name":"Uri Alon"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":574}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":104}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":127}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":112}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":117}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":131}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":124}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":65}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":54}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":12}}]}}
