{"talk":{"id":1793,"name":"Kate Stone: DJ decks made of ... paper","description":"\"I love paper, and I love technology,\" says physicist and former sheep herder Kate Stone, who's spent the past decade working to unite the two. Her experiments combine regular paper with conductive inks and tiny circuit boards to offer a unique, magical experience. To date, applications include a newspaper embedded with audio and video, posters that display energy usage in real time, and the extremely nifty paper drumkit and set of DJ decks she demonstrates onstage.","slug":"kate_stone_dj_decks_made_of_paper","recorded_at":"2013-02-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-07-23 15:01:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:33:22","viewed_count":722072,"emailed_count":95,"event":{"id":181,"name":"TED2013"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7fbb48beeb2594ad41d7cfb3bef4f21233cb9450_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7fbb48beeb2594ad41d7cfb3bef4f21233cb9450_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7fbb48beeb2594ad41d7cfb3bef4f21233cb9450_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/7fbb48beeb2594ad41d7cfb3bef4f21233cb9450_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/8be5d307ff342b601192f2eec6568d57e84f8d2e_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5774979,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15992770,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28331976,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39933003,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53468306,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":81946694,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":127702486,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5989069,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":40098903,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":82101273,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7309365,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":81967251,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KateStone_2013-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16242967,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"engineering"},{"tag":"entertainment"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":25,"name":"Design That Matters"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1505,"name":"Kate Stone"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":171}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":176}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":71}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":98}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":38}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":24}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":8}}]}}
