{"talk":{"id":2391,"name":"Raymond Wang: How germs travel on planes -- and how we can stop them","description":"Raymond Wang is only 17 years old, but he's already helping to build a healthier future. Using fluid dynamics, he created computational simulations of how air moves on airplanes, and what he found is disturbing -- when a person sneezes on a plane, the airflow actually helps to spread pathogens to other passengers. Wang shares an unforgettable animation of how a sneeze travels inside a plane cabin as well as his prize-winning solution: a small, fin-shaped device that increases fresh airflow in airplanes and redirects pathogen-laden air out of circulation.","slug":"raymond_wang_how_germs_travel_on_planes_and_how_we_can_stop_them","recorded_at":"2015-11-14 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-12-10
