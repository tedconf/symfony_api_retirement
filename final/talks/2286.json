{"talk":{"id":2286,"name":"Steve Silberman: The forgotten history of autism","description":"Decades ago, few pediatricians had heard of autism. In 1975, 1 in 5,000 kids was estimated to have it. Today, 1 in 68 is on the autism spectrum. What caused this steep rise? Steve Silberman points to \u201ca perfect storm of autism awareness\u201d \u2014 a pair of psychologists with an accepting view, an unexpected pop culture moment and a new clinical test. But to really understand, we have to go back further to an Austrian doctor by the name of Hans Asperger, who published a pioneering paper in 1944. Because it was buried in time, autism has been shrouded in misunderstanding ever since. (This talk was part of a TED2015 session curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com or @popupmag on Twitter.)","slug":"steve_silberman_the_forgotten_history_of_autism","recorded_at":"2015-03-18
