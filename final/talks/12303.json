{"talk":{"id":12303,"name":"Bob Stein: A rite of passage for late life","description":"We use rituals to mark the early stages of our lives, like birthdays and graduations -- but what about our later years? In this meditative talk about looking both backward and forward, Bob Stein proposes a new tradition of giving away your things (and sharing the stories behind them) as you get older, to reflect on your life so far and open the door to whatever comes next.","slug":"bob_stein_a_rite_of_passage_for_late_life","recorded_at":"2017-11-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-20
