{"talk":{"id":1959,"name":"Hugh Herr: The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance","description":"Hugh Herr is building the next generation of bionic limbs, robotic prosthetics inspired by nature's own designs. Herr lost both legs in a climbing accident 30 years ago; now, as the head of the MIT Media Lab's Biomechatronics group, he shows his incredible technology in a talk that's both technical and deeply personal \u2014 with the help of ballroom dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who lost her left leg in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and performs again for the first time on the TED stage.","slug":"hugh_herr_the_new_bionics_that_let_us_run_climb_and_dance","recorded_at":"2014-03-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-03-28 12:12:15","updated_at":"2020-09-28
