{"talk":{"id":2884,"name":"Nabila Alibhai: Why people of different faiths are painting their houses of worship yellow","description":"Divisions along religious lines are deepening, and we're doubting more and more how much we have in common. How can we stand boldly and visibly together? Inspired by an idea from her collaborator Yazmany Arboleda, place-maker Nabila Alibhai and her colleagues created \"Colour in Faith,\" a social practice art project that unites people of different religions by getting them to paint each other's houses of worship yellow, in a show of solidarity. \"We've proven that the human family can come together and send a message far brighter and more powerful than the voices of those that wish to do us harm,\" Alibhai says.","slug":"nabila_alibhai_why_people_of_different_faiths_are_painting_their_houses_of_worship_yellow","recorded_at":"2017-08-27
