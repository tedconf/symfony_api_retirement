{"talk":{"id":2280,"name":"LaToya Ruby Frazier: A visual history of inequality in industrial America","description":"For the last 12 years, artist and TED Fellow LaToya Ruby Frazier has photographed friends, neighbors and family in Braddock, Pennsylvania. But though the steel town has lately been hailed as a posterchild of \"rustbelt revitalization,\" Frazier's pictures tell a different story, of the real impact of inequality and environmental toxicity.
