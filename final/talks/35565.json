Here's how to know","description":"Farida Nabourema has dedicated her life to fighting the military regime in Togo, Africa's oldest autocracy. She's learned two truths along the way: no country is destined to be oppressed -- and no country is immune to dictatorship. But how can you tell if you're at risk before it happens? In a stirring talk, Nabourema shares the four key signs of a dictatorship, along with the secret to defiance for those living within an oppressive system.","slug":"farida_nabourema_is_your_country_at_risk_of_becoming_a_dictatorship_here_s_how_to_know","recorded_at":"2018-11-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-02-28 15:48:58","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:43:40","viewed_count":918349,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":574,"name":"TEDWomen 2018"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/89eb89e03f58eaf57e07ca08ad8716adb3dac487_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/89eb89e03f58eaf57e07ca08ad8716adb3dac487_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/89eb89e03f58eaf57e07ca08ad8716adb3dac487_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/89eb89e03f58eaf57e07ca08ad8716adb3dac487_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/da1a80d5812ae54ec557bb262afce2f816cc6217_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5591272,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15476945,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":27415528,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38648373,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":51782549,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":81253404,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":125593669,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5805232,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38814466,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":81390252,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6890634,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15739617,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FaridaNabourema_2018W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":81394200,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Africa"},{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"corruption"},{"tag":"democracy"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"politics"},{"tag":"protest"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4844,"name":"Farida Nabourema"}}],"ratings":[]}}
