{"talk":{"id":9687,"name":"John Cary: How architecture can create dignity for all","description":"If architect and writer John Cary has his way, women will never need to stand in pointlessly long bathroom lines again. Lines like these are representative of a more serious issue, Cary says: the lack of diversity in design that leads to thoughtless, compassionless spaces. Design has a unique ability to dignify and make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen -- but the flip side is also true. Cary calls for architects and designers to expand their ranks and commit to serving the public good, not just the privileged few. \"Well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste or a questions of aesthetics,\" he says. \"They literally shape our ideas about who we are in the world and what we deserve.\" And we all deserve better.","slug":"john_cary_how_architecture_can_create_dignity_for_all","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-02-07 15:54:42","updated_at":"2021-04-13
