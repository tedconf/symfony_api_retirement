{"talk":{"id":1824,"name":"Andras Forgacs: Leather and meat without killing animals","description":"By 2050, it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world's population with meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods. Maintaining this herd will take a huge, potentially unsustainable toll on the planet. What if there were a different way? In this eye-opening talk, tissue engineering advocate Andras Forgacs argues that biofabricating meat and leather is a civilized way to move past killing animals for hamburgers and handbags.","slug":"andras_forgacs_leather_and_meat_without_killing_animals","recorded_at":"2013-06-13 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-09-19 15:01:26","updated_at":"2021-04-09
