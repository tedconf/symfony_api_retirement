{"talk":{"id":64040,"name":"Nigel Topping: We need to green the economy while restarting it","description":"Nigel Topping has a cool job: he's the UK's High Level Climate Action Champion for COP26, the UN's climate change conference taking place in 2021. In this wide-ranging interview, Topping discusses his work with scientists, businesses and cities to drive action on climate change and get the world committed to net zero emissions by 2050. He also explains why he thinks the COVID-19 pandemic could accelerate the transition to a green economy, creating jobs that will last and building a cleaner world for us all. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED global curator Bruno Giussani and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded May 26, 2020.)","slug":"nigel_topping_we_need_to_green_the_economy_while_restarting_it","recorded_at":"2020-05-26 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-06-09 20:01:08","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:40:48","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9f7c22fa99f6f4db071f12f2aaf71656f0ea3676_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9f7c22fa99f6f4db071f12f2aaf71656f0ea3676_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9f7c22fa99f6f4db071f12f2aaf71656f0ea3676_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/9f7c22fa99f6f4db071f12f2aaf71656f0ea3676_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/a0d27c2517402f5593af07004bc2de7d184fa47d_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20032115,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55770763,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98618760,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":138446126,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":184470901,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":285957089,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":445800410,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20291041,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":138965461,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":286233608,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NigelTopping_2020.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12831915,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"tags":[{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"coronavirus"},{"tag":"energy"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"international development"},{"tag":"sustainability"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5958,"name":"Nigel Topping"}},{"speaker":{"id":2051,"name":"Bruno Giussani"}}],"ratings":[]}}
