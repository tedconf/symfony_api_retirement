{"talk":{"id":1350,"name":"Stephen Coleman: Non-lethal weapons, a moral hazard?","description":"Pepper spray, Tasers, tear gas, rubber bullets -- these \"non-lethal\" weapons are being used by more and more local police forces, as well as military forces brought in to control civilian crowds and other situations. Despite their name, non-lethal weapons have been known to cause deaths ... and as Stephen Coleman suggests, there are other, more insidious hazards as well. He explores the complex ethics -- and the unexpected consequences -- of using non-lethal weapons to control civilians.","slug":"stephen_coleman_non_lethal_weapons_a_moral_hazard","recorded_at":"2011-09-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-02-07 16:08:24","updated_at":"2021-04-09
