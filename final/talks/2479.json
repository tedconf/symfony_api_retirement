{"talk":{"id":2479,"name":"Mary Norris: The nit-picking glory of The New Yorker's Comma Queen","description":"\"Copy editing for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major League Baseball team -- every little movement gets picked over by the critics,\" says Mary Norris, who has played the position for more than thirty years.
