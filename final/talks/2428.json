{"talk":{"id":2428,"name":"Dorothy Roberts: The problem with race-based medicine","description":"Social justice advocate and law scholar Dorothy Roberts has a precise and powerful message: Race-based medicine is bad medicine. Even today, many doctors still use race as a medical shortcut; they make important decisions about things like pain tolerance based on a patient's skin color instead of medical observation and measurement. In this searing talk, Roberts lays out the lingering traces of race-based medicine -- and invites us to be a part of ending it. \"It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy,\" she says, \"and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.\"","slug":"dorothy_roberts_the_problem_with_race_based_medicine","recorded_at":"2015-11-18
