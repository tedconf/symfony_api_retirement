{"talk":{"id":9048,"name":"Matt Goldman: The search for \"aha!\" moments","description":"In 1988, Matt Goldman co-founded Blue Man Group, an off-Broadway production that became a sensation known for its humor, blue body paint and wild stunts. The show works on the premise that certain conditions can create \"aha moments\" -- moments of surprise, learning and exuberance -- frequent and intentional rather than random and occasional. Now Goldman is working to apply the lessons learned from Blue Man Group to education, creating Blue School, a school that balances academic mastery, creative thinking and self and social intelligence. \"We need to cultivate safe and conducive conditions for new and innovative ideas to evolve and thrive,\" Goldman says.","slug":"matt_goldman_the_search_for_aha_moments","recorded_at":"2017-10-17
