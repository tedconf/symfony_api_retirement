{"talk":{"id":1995,"name":"Deborah Gordon: What ants teach us about the brain, cancer and the Internet","description":"Ecologist Deborah Gordon studies ants wherever she can find them -- in the desert, in the tropics, in her kitchen ... In this fascinating talk, she explains her obsession with insects most of us would happily swat away without a second thought. She argues that ant life provides a useful model for learning about many other topics, including disease, technology and the human brain.","slug":"deborah_gordon_what_ants_teach_us_about_the_brain_cancer_and_the_internet","recorded_at":"2014-03-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-05-13 15:02:17","updated_at":"2021-04-09
