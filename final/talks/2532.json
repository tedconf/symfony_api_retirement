{"talk":{"id":2532,"name":"Michael Murphy: Architecture that's built to heal","description":"Architecture is more than a clever arrangement of bricks. In this eloquent talk, Michael Murphy shows how he and his team look far beyond the blueprint when they're designing. Considering factors from airflow to light, theirs is a holistic approach that produces community as well as (beautiful) buildings. He takes us on a tour of projects in countries such as Rwanda and Haiti, and reveals a moving, ambitious plan for The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which he hopes will heal hearts in the American South.","slug":"michael_murphy_architecture_that_s_built_to_heal","recorded_at":"2016-02-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-09-15 15:03:59","updated_at":"2021-04-13
