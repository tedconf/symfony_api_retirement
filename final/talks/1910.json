{"talk":{"id":1910,"name":"Paula Johnson: His and hers ... health care","description":"Every cell in the human body has a sex, which means that men and women are different right down to the cellular level. Yet too often, research and medicine ignore this insight -- and the often startlingly different ways in which the two sexes respond to disease or treatment. As pioneering doctor Paula Johnson describes in this thought-provoking talk, lumping everyone in together means we essentially leave women's health to chance. It's time to rethink.","slug":"paula_johnson_his_and_hers_health_care","recorded_at":"2013-12-05 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-01-22 16:07:14","updated_at":"2021-04-09
