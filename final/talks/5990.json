{"talk":{"id":5990,"name":"R\u00e9becca Kleinberger: Why you don't like the sound of your own voice","description":"Your voice is indistinguishable from how other people see you, but your relationship with it is far from obvious. R\u00e9becca Kleinberger studies how we use and understand our voices and the voices of others. She explains why you may not like the sound of your own voice on recordings, the differences between your outward, inward and inner voices -- and the extraordinary things you communicate without being aware of it.","slug":"rebecca_kleinberger_why_you_don_t_like_the_sound_of_your_own_voice","recorded_at":"2017-11-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-05-03 20:00:50","updated_at":"2021-04-13
