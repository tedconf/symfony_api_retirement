{"talk":{"id":2249,"name":"Anand Varma: The first 21 days of a bee's life","description":"We've heard that bees are disappearing. But what is making bee colonies so vulnerable? Photographer Anand Varma raised bees in his backyard \u2014 in front of a camera \u2014 to get an up close view. This project, for National Geographic, gives a lyrical glimpse into a beehive, and reveals one of the biggest threats to its health, a mite that preys on baby bees in their first 21 days of life. With footage set to music from Rob Moose and the Magik*Magik Orchestra, Varma shows the problem ... and what's being done to solve it. (This talk was part of a session at TED2015 guest-curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com or @popupmag on Twitter.)","slug":"anand_varma_the_first_21_days_of_a_bee_s_life","recorded_at":"2015-03-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-05-11 15:19:50","updated_at":"2020-09-28
