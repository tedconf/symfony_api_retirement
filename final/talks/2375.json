{"talk":{"id":2375,"name":"Ole Scheeren: Why great architecture should tell a story","description":"For architect Ole Scheeren, the people who live and work inside a building are as much a part of that building as concrete, steel and glass. He asks: Can architecture be about collaboration and storytelling instead of the isolation and hierarchy of a typical skyscraper? Visit five of Scheeren's buildings -- from a twisted tower in China to a floating cinema in the ocean in Thailand -- and learn the stories behind them.","slug":"ole_scheeren_why_great_architecture_should_tell_a_story","recorded_at":"2015-09-29 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-01-14 16:22:03","updated_at":"2021-04-13
