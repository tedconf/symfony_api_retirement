{"talk":{"id":2738,"name":"Siddhartha Roy: Science in service to the public good","description":"We give scientists and engineers great technical training, but we're not as good at teaching ethical decision-making or building character. Take, for example, the environmental crisis that recently unfolded in Flint, Michigan -- and the professionals there who did nothing to fix it. Siddhartha Roy helped prove that Flint's water was contaminated, and he tells a story of science in service to the public good, calling on the next generation of scientists and engineers to dedicate their work to protecting people and the planet.","slug":"siddhartha_roy_science_in_service_to_the_public_good","recorded_at":"2016-11-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-04-25
