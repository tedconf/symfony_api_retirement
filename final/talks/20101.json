{"talk":{"id":20101,"name":"Stephen Webb: Where are all the aliens?","description":"The universe is incredibly old, astoundingly vast and populated by trillions of planets -- so where are all the aliens? Astronomer Stephen Webb has an explanation: we're alone in the universe. In a mind-expanding talk, he spells out the remarkable barriers a planet would need to clear in order to host an extraterrestrial civilization -- and makes a case for the beauty of our potential cosmic loneliness. \"The silence of the universe is shouting, 'We're the creatures who got lucky,'\" Webb says.","slug":"stephen_webb_where_are_all_the_aliens","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-07-19 14:56:12","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:40:32","viewed_count":3712055,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":494,"name":"TED2018"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/339766aead0c38c603a4da907cc6880e06bc41a2_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/339766aead0c38c603a4da907cc6880e06bc41a2_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/339766aead0c38c603a4da907cc6880e06bc41a2_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/339766aead0c38c603a4da907cc6880e06bc41a2_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/97df0c9a56e1844eac4c5f08245a60e32a2afaec_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6580998,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18226233,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32294397,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45492877,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":60884043,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":95477819,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":147876456,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6795240,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45658843,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":95614617,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8069530,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18487743,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/StephenWebb_2018-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":95611939,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sl":{"name":"Slovenian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Planets"},{"tag":"aliens"},{"tag":"astronomy"},{"tag":"exploration"},{"tag":"physics"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"space"},{"tag":"time"},{"tag":"universe"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3951,"name":"Stephen Webb"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":107}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":15}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":54}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":34}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":112}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":31}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":59}}]}}
