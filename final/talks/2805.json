{"talk":{"id":2805,"name":"David Miliband: The refugee crisis is a test of our character","description":"Sixty-five million people were displaced from their homes by conflict and disaster in 2016. It's not just a crisis; it's a test of who we are and what we stand for, says David Miliband -- and each of us has a personal responsibility to help solve it. In this must-watch talk, Miliband gives us specific, tangible ways to help refugees and turn empathy and altruism into action.","slug":"david_miliband_the_refugee_crisis_is_a_test_of_our_character","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-06-20 03:39:41","updated_at":"2021-04-09
