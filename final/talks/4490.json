{"talk":{"id":4490,"name":"Leah Chase and Pat Mitchell: An interview with the Queen of Creole Cuisine","description":"Leah Chase's New Orleans restaurant Dooky Chase changed the course of American history over gumbo and fried chicken. During the civil rights movement, it was a place where white and black people came together, where activists planned protests and where the police entered but did not disturb -- and it continues to operate in the same spirit today. In conversation with TEDWomen Curator Pat Mitchell, the 94-year old Queen of Creole Cuisine shares her wisdom from a lifetime of activism, speaking up and cooking.","slug":"leah_chase_and_pat_mitchell_an_interview_with_the_queen_of_creole_cuisine","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-11-22 21:00:21","updated_at":"2020-09-29 21:43:25","viewed_count":1294096,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":471,"name":"TEDWomen 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/8bbc26d255affef894e59ac07a7e0d468f2eb317_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/8bbc26d255affef894e59ac07a7e0d468f2eb317_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/8bbc26d255affef894e59ac07a7e0d468f2eb317_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/8bbc26d255affef894e59ac07a7e0d468f2eb317_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/914f579f967f7d8ba27f53becdb125eb3b76b7b7_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11176419,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31042117,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":54945864,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77282385,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":103179348,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":162215544,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":251966194,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11390777,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77448467,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":162352015,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13665224,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31295105,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/LeahChase_2017W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":162358188,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"}},"tags":[{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"family"},{"tag":"food"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"interview"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"personal growth"},{"tag":"race"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"women"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3695,"name":"Leah Chase"}},{"speaker":{"id":1021,"name":"Pat Mitchell"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":104}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":42}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":30}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":58}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":87}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":34}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":2}}]}}
