{"talk":{"id":1080,"name":"Iain Hutchison: Saving faces: A facial surgeon's craft","description":"Maxillofacial surgeon Iain Hutchison works with people whose faces have been severely disfigured. By pushing to improve surgical techniques, he helps to improve their lives; and by commissioning their portraits, he celebrates their humanity. NOTE: This talk contains images of disfigured and badly injured faces that may be disturbing -- and Hutchison provides thoughtful answers as to why a disfigured face can shock us so deeply. Squeamish? Hide your screen from 12:10 - 13:19, but do keep listening. Portraits shown in this talk come from Mark Gilbert.","slug":"iain_hutchison_saving_faces_a_facial_surgeon_s_craft","recorded_at":"2010-07-14 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-02-22 15:26:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:15:45","viewed_count":637532,"emailed_count":110,"event":{"id":39,"name":"TEDGlobal 2010"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/80b150d8016ef7766a17e2f7091b797a0826d5c8_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/80b150d8016ef7766a17e2f7091b797a0826d5c8_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/80b150d8016ef7766a17e2f7091b797a0826d5c8_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"800x600","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/80b150d8016ef7766a17e2f7091b797a0826d5c8_800x600.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7822482,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21691136,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38461364,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53995553,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72184321,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":110484895,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":173006632,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7959815,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":54283165,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":110896257,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9715620,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21905736,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IainHutchison_2010G-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111089087,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Surgery"},{"tag":"body language"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"medical research"},{"tag":"science"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":47,"name":"Medicine Without Borders"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":730,"name":"Iain Hutchison"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":67}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":104}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":179}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":34}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":172}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":93}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":31}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":5}}]}}
