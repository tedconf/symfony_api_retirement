{"talk":{"id":2828,"name":"Fran\u00e7oise Mouly: The stories behind The New Yorker's iconic covers","description":"Meet Fran\u00e7oise Mouly, The New Yorker's art director. For the past 24 years, she's helped decide what appears on the magazine's famous cover, from the black-on-black depiction of the Twin Towers the week after 9\/11 to a recent, Russia-influenced riff on the magazine's mascot, Eustace Tilley. In this visual retrospective, Mouly considers how a simple drawing can cut through the torrent of images that we see every day and elegantly capture the feeling (and the sensibility) of a moment in time.","slug":"francoise_mouly_the_stories_behind_the_new_yorker_s_iconic_covers","recorded_at":"2017-03-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-08-03 14:24:04","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:16:10","viewed_count":1221156,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":429,"name":"TEDNYC"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b09b59c6232dc36dfe95a7595e77b66f6e1403f7_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b09b59c6232dc36dfe95a7595e77b66f6e1403f7_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b09b59c6232dc36dfe95a7595e77b66f6e1403f7_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b09b59c6232dc36dfe95a7595e77b66f6e1403f7_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/a9b583d4808d6fafa61feea5acaf4b0d8a080bfb_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4222222,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11616166,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20579681,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28960746,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38689161,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":61264392,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":94166132,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4481059,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":29479893,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":61523169,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5181964,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11876153,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FrancoiseMouly_2017S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":61511781,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"art"},{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"humor"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3362,"name":"Fran\u00e7oise Mouly"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":19}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":46}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":15}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":19}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":19}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":1}}]}}
