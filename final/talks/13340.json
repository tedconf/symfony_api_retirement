{"talk":{"id":13340,"name":"Robert Neuwirth: The age-old sharing economies of Africa -- and why we should scale them","description":"From rides to homes and beyond, we're sharing everything these days, with the help of digital tools. But as modern and high-tech as the sharing economy seems, it's been alive in Africa for centuries, according to author Robert Neuwirth. He shares fascinating examples -- like apprenticeships that work like locally generated venture capital and systems for allocating scarce water -- and says that if we can propagate and scale these models, they could help communities thrive from the bottom up.","slug":"robert_neuwirth_the_age_old_sharing_economies_of_africa_and_why_we_should_scale_them","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-05-17 14:38:55","updated_at":"2021-10-22 20:42:04","viewed_count":1169018,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":465,"name":"TEDGlobal 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4ea2b60ceb7bffb7e929394f337feb141bf57ed4_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4ea2b60ceb7bffb7e929394f337feb141bf57ed4_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4ea2b60ceb7bffb7e929394f337feb141bf57ed4_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4ea2b60ceb7bffb7e929394f337feb141bf57ed4_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d732b9ace78f2860b3ebfdb340bcc75cae763e9e_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4596697,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12658978,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22471193,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31737800,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42579894,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":66672761,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102694538,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4861758,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32093859,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67233602,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5639892,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12929381,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertNeuwirth_2017G-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67189885,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Africa"},{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"money"},{"tag":"trust"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":43,"name":"Robert Neuwirth"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":16}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":30}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":1}}]}}
