{"talk":{"id":4755,"name":"Justin Baldoni: Why I'm done trying to be \"man enough\"","description":"Justin Baldoni wants to start a dialogue with men about redefining masculinity -- to figure out ways to be not just good men but good humans. In a warm, personal talk, he shares his effort to reconcile who he is with who the world tells him a man should be. And he has a challenge for men: \"See if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper,\" Baldoni says. \"Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? Are you strong enough to be sensitive? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?\"","slug":"justin_baldoni_why_i_m_done_trying_to_be_man_enough","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-12-04
