{"talk":{"id":2628,"name":"Sandi Toksvig: A political party for women's equality","description":"Women's equality won't just happen -- not unless more women are put in positions of power, says Sandi Toksvig. In a disarmingly hilarious talk, Toksvig tells the story of how she helped start a new political party in Britain, the Women's Equality Party, with the express purpose of putting equality on the ballot. Now she hopes people around the world will copy her party's model and mobilize for equality.","slug":"sandi_toksvig_a_political_party_for_women_s_equality","recorded_at":"2016-10-27
