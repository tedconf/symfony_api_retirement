{"talk":{"id":43379,"name":"Ethan Lindenberger: Why we need to fight misinformation about vaccines","description":"Ethan Lindenberger never got vaccinated as a kid. So one day, he went on Reddit and asked a simple question: \"Where do I go to get vaccinated?\" The post went viral, landing Lindenberger in the middle of a heated debate about vaccination and, ultimately, in front of a US Senate committee. Less than a year later, the high school senior reports back on his unexpected time in the spotlight and a new movement he's leading to fight misinformation and advocate for scientific truth.","slug":"ethan_lindenberger_why_we_need_to_fight_misinformation_about_vaccines","recorded_at":"2019-04-22 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-06-25 14:49:09","updated_at":"2021-10-22 20:44:14","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":120,"name":"TEDxMidAtlantic"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6aa3f401800ccfe8368b7644500e11815eddaf5e_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6aa3f401800ccfe8368b7644500e11815eddaf5e_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6aa3f401800ccfe8368b7644500e11815eddaf5e_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6aa3f401800ccfe8368b7644500e11815eddaf5e_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1b33a3dadd8ffe7299af7b49768e6e49414ebb37_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3656190,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10075734,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17826564,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25110436,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33551524,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52073438,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":80176121,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3915085,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25629459,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52350253,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4530211,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10327709,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EthanLindenberger_2019X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52342257,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"Vaccines"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"health care"},{"tag":"media"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5432,"name":"Ethan Lindenberger"}}],"ratings":[]}}
