{"talk":{"id":1137,"name":"Carlo Ratti: Architecture that senses and responds","description":"With his team at SENSEable City Lab, MIT's Carlo Ratti makes cool things by sensing the data we create. He pulls from passive data sets -- like the calls we make, the garbage we throw away -- to create surprising visualizations of city life. And he and his team create dazzling interactive environments from moving water and flying light, powered by simple gestures caught through sensors.","slug":"carlo_ratti_architecture_that_senses_and_responds","recorded_at":"2011-03-02 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-05-03 14:38:00","updated_at":"2021-05-24
