{"talk":{"id":968,"name":"Inge Missmahl: Bringing peace to the minds of Afghanistan","description":"When Jungian analyst Inge Missmahl visited Afghanistan, she saw the inner wounds of war -- widespread despair, trauma and depression. And yet, in this county of 30 million people, there were only two dozen psychiatrists. Missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country's system of psychosocial counseling, promoting both individual and, perhaps, national healing.","slug":"inge_missmahl_bringing_peace_to_the_minds_of_afghanistan","recorded_at":"2010-07-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2010-09-29 08:24:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
