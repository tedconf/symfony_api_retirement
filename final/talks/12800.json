Tribal attorney and Couchiching First Nation citizen Tara Houska chronicles the history of attempts by government and industry to eradicate the legitimacy of Indigenous peoples' land and culture, including the months-long standoff at Standing Rock which rallied thousands around the world. \"It's incredible what you can do when you stand together,\" Houska says. \"Stand with us -- empathize, learn, grow, change the conversation.\"","slug":"tara_houska_the_standing_rock_resistance_and_our_fight_for_indigenous_rights","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-09
