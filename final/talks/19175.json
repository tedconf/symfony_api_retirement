{"talk":{"id":19175,"name":"Travis Rieder: The agony of opioid withdrawal -- and what doctors should tell patients about it","description":"The United States accounts for five percent of the world's population but consumes almost 70 percent of the total global opioid supply, creating an epidemic that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths each year. How did we get here, and what can we do about it? In this personal talk, Travis Rieder recounts the painful, often-hidden struggle of opioid withdrawal and reveals how doctors who are quick to prescribe (and overprescribe) opioids aren't equipped with the tools to eventually get people off the meds.","slug":"travis_rieder_the_agony_of_opioid_withdrawal_and_what_doctors_should_tell_patients_about_it","recorded_at":"2017-10-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-06-28 15:00:34","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:36:56","viewed_count":1834093,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":120,"name":"TEDxMidAtlantic"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/08ea7f0d2cb014e75072578654e0253bed2eb5b2_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/08ea7f0d2cb014e75072578654e0253bed2eb5b2_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/08ea7f0d2cb014e75072578654e0253bed2eb5b2_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/08ea7f0d2cb014e75072578654e0253bed2eb5b2_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/eaf891d62a3d0d11d9048f3bb06d0a58aaf9a976_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7057095,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19567643,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34604260,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48642071,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":64902902,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102650463,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":158774065,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7315985,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49161224,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102909447,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8657814,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19821737,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/TravisRieder_2017X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102905716,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"gl":{"name":"Galician"},"de":{"name":"German"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"drugs"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"medicine"},{"tag":"public health"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4128,"name":"Travis Rieder"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":57}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":24}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":47}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":2}}]}}
