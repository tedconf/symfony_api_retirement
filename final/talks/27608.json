{"talk":{"id":27608,"name":"Teresa Bejan: Is civility a sham?","description":"What exactly is civility, and what does it require? In a talk packed with historical insights, political theorist Teresa Bejan explains how civility has been used as both the foundation of tolerant societies and as a way for political partisans to silence and dismiss opposing views. Bejan suggests that we should instead try for \"mere civility\": the virtue of being able to disagree fundamentally with others without destroying the possibility of a common life tomorrow.
