{"talk":{"id":2733,"name":"Amy Green: A video game to cope with grief","description":"When Amy Green's young son was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor, she made up a bedtime story for his siblings to teach them about cancer. What resulted was a video game, \"That Dragon, Cancer,\" which takes players on a journey they can't win. In this beautiful talk about coping with loss, Green brings joy and play to tragedy. \"We made a game that's hard to play,\" she says, \"because the hardest moments of our lives change us more than any goal we could ever accomplish.\"","slug":"amy_green_a_video_game_to_cope_with_grief","recorded_at":"2017-02-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-04-19 14:59:14","updated_at":"2021-04-09
