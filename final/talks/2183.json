{"talk":{"id":2183,"name":"Marc Kushner: Why the buildings of the future will be shaped by ... you","description":"\"Architecture is not about math or zoning -- it's about visceral emotions,\" says Marc Kushner. In a sweeping \u2014 often funny \u2014 talk, he zooms through the past thirty years of architecture to show how the public, once disconnected, have become an essential part of the design process. With the help of social media, feedback reaches architects years before a building is even created. The result? Architecture that will do more for us than ever before.","slug":"marc_kushner_why_the_buildings_of_the_future_will_be_shaped_by_you","recorded_at":"2014-03-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-03-10
