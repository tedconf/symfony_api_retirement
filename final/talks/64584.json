{"talk":{"id":64584,"name":"Nir Eyal: The case to infect volunteers with COVID-19 to accelerate vaccine testing","description":"Conventional vaccine testing is a slow, years-long process. As thousands of people continue to die each day from COVID-19, bioethicist Nir Eyal proposes a radical idea that could dramatically accelerate the vaccine development timeline: \"human challenge trials,\" in which scientists would deliberately expose volunteers to the virus to more quickly determine a vaccine's efficacy. (This virtual conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson, was recorded June 15, 2020.)","slug":"nir_eyal_the_case_to_infect_volunteers_with_covid_19_to_accelerate_vaccine_testing","recorded_at":"2020-06-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-06-25 14:51:26","updated_at":"2020-10-05 17:17:34","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/277c8a339c351a8f8c252931010826f35a0aeb23_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/277c8a339c351a8f8c252931010826f35a0aeb23_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/277c8a339c351a8f8c252931010826f35a0aeb23_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/277c8a339c351a8f8c252931010826f35a0aeb23_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fa3b8a1ef536a5c49dcb9e8def2ede69b07d5133_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9149362,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25397080,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44908002,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":63099691,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":84133734,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":132933813,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":206071288,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9407840,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":63618787,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":133190207,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/NirEyal_2020.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9915600,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"tags":[{"tag":"Vaccines"},{"tag":"coronavirus"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"medicine"},{"tag":"public health"},{"tag":"science"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6024,"name":"Nir Eyal"}},{"speaker":{"id":187,"name":"Chris Anderson"}},{"speaker":{"id":4697,"name":"David Biello"}}],"ratings":[]}}
