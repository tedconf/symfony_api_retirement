{"talk":{"id":1291,"name":"Charles Limb: Building the musical muscle","description":"Charles Limb performs cochlear implantation, a surgery that treats hearing loss and can restore the ability to hear speech. But as a musician too, Limb thinks about what the implants lack: They don't let you fully experience music yet. (There's a hair-raising example.)
