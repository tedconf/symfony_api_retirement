{"talk":{"id":9987,"name":"Guy Winch: How to fix a broken heart","description":"At some point in our lives, almost every one of us will have our heart broken. Imagine how different things would be if we paid more attention to this unique emotional pain. Psychologist Guy Winch reveals how recovering from heartbreak starts with a determination to fight our instincts to idealize and search for answers that aren't there -- and offers a toolkit on how to, eventually, move on. Our hearts might sometimes be broken, but we don't have to break with them.","slug":"guy_winch_how_to_fix_a_broken_heart","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-02-05
