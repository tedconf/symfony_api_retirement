{"talk":{"id":2534,"name":"Wanda Diaz Merced: How a blind astronomer found a way to hear the stars","description":"Wanda Diaz Merced studies the light emitted by gamma-ray bursts, the most energetic events in the universe. When she lost her sight and was left without a way to do her science, she had a revelatory insight: the light curves she could no longer see could be translated into sound. Through sonification, she regained mastery over her work, and now she's advocating for a more inclusive scientific community. \"Science is for everyone,\" she says. \"It has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explorers.\"","slug":"wanda_diaz_merced_how_a_blind_astronomer_found_a_way_to_hear_the_stars","recorded_at":"2016-02-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-06-27
