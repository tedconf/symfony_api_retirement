{"talk":{"id":1569,"name":"Amy Cuddy: Your body language may shape who you are","description":"(NOTE: Some of the findings presented in this talk have been referenced in an ongoing debate among social scientists about robustness and reproducibility. Read \"Criticisms & updates\" below for more details as well as Amy Cuddy's response.) Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves.
