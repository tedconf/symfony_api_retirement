{"talk":{"id":3367,"name":"Margrethe Vestager: The new age of corporate monopolies","description":"Margrethe Vestager wants to keep European markets competitive -- which is why, on behalf of the EU, she's fined Google $2.8 billion for breaching antitrust rules, asked Apple for $15.3 billion in back taxes and investigated a range of companies, from Gazprom to Fiat, for anti-competitive practices. In an important talk about the state of the global business, she explains why markets need clear rules -- and how even the most innovative companies can become a problem when they become too dominant. \"Real and fair competition has a vital role to play in building the trust we need to get the best of our societies,\" Vestager says. \"And that starts with enforcing our rules.\"","slug":"margrethe_vestager_the_new_age_of_corporate_monopolies","recorded_at":"2017-09-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-10-18 14:56:56","updated_at":"2021-04-09
