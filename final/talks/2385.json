{"talk":{"id":2385,"name":"Kristen Marhaver: How we're growing baby corals to rebuild reefs","description":"Kristen Marhaver studies corals, tiny creatures the size of a poppyseed that, over hundreds of slow years, create beautiful, life-sustaining ocean structures hundreds of miles long. As she admits, it's easy to get sad about the state of coral reefs; they're in the news lately because of how quickly they're bleaching, dying and turning to slime. But the good news is that we're learning more and more about these amazing marine invertebrates -- including how to help them (and help them help us). This biologist and TED Senior Fellow offers a glimpse into the wonderful and mysterious lives of these hard-working and fragile creatures.","slug":"kristen_marhaver_how_we_re_growing_baby_corals_to_rebuild_reefs","recorded_at":"2015-10-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-12-01 16:04:58","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:44:09","viewed_count":849120,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":401,"name":"Mission Blue II"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f1e5336ce97d32386248f4feb201e1337591dd86_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f1e5336ce97d32386248f4feb201e1337591dd86_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f1e5336ce97d32386248f4feb201e1337591dd86_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f1e5336ce97d32386248f4feb201e1337591dd86_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/227938cb400663b2cb85b8732f2d57922f29dee9_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6804544,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18865002,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33406323,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47054473,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62950286,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98848339,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":153057984,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6937987,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47169820,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98840571,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19111591,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristenMarhaver_2015Z-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":98841766,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"animals"},{"tag":"biology"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"coral reefs"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"marine biology"},{"tag":"microbiology"},{"tag":"nature"},{"tag":"ocean"},{"tag":"pollution"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"water"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2498,"name":"Kristen Marhaver"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":208}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":252}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":249}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":32}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":180}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":84}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":22}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":3}}]}}
