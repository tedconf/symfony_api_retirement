{"talk":{"id":63575,"name":"Kristalina Georgieva: How to rebuild the global economy","description":"The coronavirus pandemic shattered the global economy. To put the pieces back together, we need to make sure money is going to the countries that need it the most -- and that we rebuild financial systems that are resilient to shocks, says Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. She takes us inside the massive economic stimulus efforts leading the world toward recovery and renewal and discusses what it will take for countries to emerge from this \"great transformation\" even stronger than before. (This virtual conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson and current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was recorded on May 18, 2020.)","slug":"kristalina_georgieva_how_to_rebuild_the_global_economy","recorded_at":"2020-05-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-05-19 19:57:17","updated_at":"2022-05-23 16:04:34","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/140fff43907cd60b91ed0f45697bb0221ee7e83e_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/140fff43907cd60b91ed0f45697bb0221ee7e83e_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/140fff43907cd60b91ed0f45697bb0221ee7e83e_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/140fff43907cd60b91ed0f45697bb0221ee7e83e_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ff9f394e0f67d8be2a02f9c696c9f273a1917e8c_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20889860,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58190718,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":102838637,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":144400396,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":192347686,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":300501860,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":470046877,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21148469,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":144919411,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":300778558,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58448584,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/KristalinaGeorgieva_2020-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":300807825,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"coronavirus"},{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"finance"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"pandemic"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5954,"name":"Kristalina Georgieva"}},{"speaker":{"id":187,"name":"Chris Anderson"}},{"speaker":{"id":5278,"name":"Whitney Pennington Rodgers"}}],"ratings":[]}}
