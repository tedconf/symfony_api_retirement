{"talk":{"id":1852,"name":"Parul Sehgal: An ode to envy","description":"What is jealousy? What drives it, and why do we secretly love it? No study has ever been able to capture its \"loneliness, longevity, grim thrill\" -- that is, says Parul Sehgal, except for fiction. In an eloquent meditation she scours pages from literature to show how jealousy is not so different from a quest for knowledge.","slug":"parul_sehgal_an_ode_to_envy","recorded_at":"2013-07-25
