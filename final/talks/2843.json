{"talk":{"id":2843,"name":"Ashton Applewhite: Let's end ageism","description":"It's not the passage of time that makes it so hard to get older. It's ageism, a prejudice that pits us against our future selves -- and each other. Ashton Applewhite urges us to dismantle the dread and mobilize against the last socially acceptable prejudice. \"Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured,\" she says. \"It is a
