{"talk":{"id":8779,"name":"Azim Khamisa and Ples Felix: What comes after tragedy? Forgiveness","description":"On one awful night in 1995, Ples Felix's 14-year-old grandson murdered Azim Khamisa's son in a gang initiation fueled by drugs, alcohol and a false sense of belonging. The deadly encounter sent Khamisa and Felix down paths of deep meditation, to forgive and to be forgiven -- and in an act of bravery and reconciliation, the two men met and forged a lasting bond. Together, they've used their story as an outline for a better, more merciful society, where victims of tragedy can grow and heal. Prepare to be moved by their unimaginable story. \"Peace is possible,\" Khamisa says. \"How do I know that? Because I am at peace.\"","slug":"azim_khamisa_and_ples_felix_what_comes_after_tragedy_forgiveness","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-19 21:00:40","updated_at":"2021-04-09
