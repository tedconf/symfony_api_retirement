{"talk":{"id":2152,"name":"Khalida Brohi: How I work to protect women from honor killings","description":"Nearly 1000 \"honor\" killings are reported in Pakistan each year, murders by a family member for behavior deemed \"shameful,\" such as a relationship outside of marriage. When Khalida Brohi lost a close friend to the practice, she resolved to campaign against it. Yet she met resistance from an unlikely source: the very community she hoped to protect. In this powerful, honest talk, Brohi shares how she took a hard look at her own process, and offers sharp insights for other passionate activists.","slug":"khalida_brohi_how_i_work_to_protect_women_from_honor_killings","recorded_at":"2014-10-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-02-24 15:58:06","updated_at":"2020-10-07
