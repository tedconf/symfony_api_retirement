{"talk":{"id":1052,"name":"Elizabeth Lesser: Take \"the Other\" to lunch","description":"There's an angry divisive tension in the air that threatens to make modern politics impossible. Elizabeth Lesser explores the two sides of human nature within us (call them \"the mystic\" and \"the warrior\u201d) that can be harnessed to elevate the way we treat each other. She shares a simple way to begin real dialogue -- by going to lunch with someone who doesn't agree with you, and asking them three questions to find out what's really in their hearts.","slug":"elizabeth_lesser_take_the_other_to_lunch","recorded_at":"2010-12-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-01-13 15:57:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13
