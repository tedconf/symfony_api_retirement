{"talk":{"id":2597,"name":"Ione Wells: How we talk about sexual assault online","description":"We need a more considered approach to using social media for social justice, says writer and activist Ione Wells. After she was the victim of an assault in London, Wells published a letter to her attacker in a student newspaper that went viral and sparked the #NotGuilty campaign against sexual violence and victim-blaming. In this moving talk, she describes how sharing her personal story gave hope to others and delivers a powerful message against the culture of online shaming.","slug":"ione_wells_how_we_talk_about_sexual_assault_online","recorded_at":"2016-06-30 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-10-10 15:25:42","updated_at":"2020-09-28
