{"talk":{"id":3013,"name":"Greg Gage: Electrical experiments with plants that count and communicate","description":"Neuroscientist Greg Gage takes sophisticated equipment used to study the brain out of graduate-level labs and brings them to middle- and high-school classrooms (and, sometimes, to the TED stage.) Prepare to be amazed as he hooks up the Mimosa pudica, a plant whose leaves close when touched, and the Venus flytrap to an EKG to show us how plants use electrical signals to convey information, prompt movement and even count.","slug":"greg_gage_electrical_experiments_with_plants_that_count_and_communicate","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-10-10
