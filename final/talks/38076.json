{"talk":{"id":38076,"name":"Michele Wucker: Why we ignore obvious problems -- and how to act on them","description":"Why do we often neglect big problems, like the financial crisis and climate change, until it's too late? Policy strategist Michele Wucker urges us to replace the myth of the \"black swan\" -- that rare, unforeseeable, unavoidable catastrophe -- with the reality of the \"gray rhino,\" the preventable danger that we choose to ignore. She shows why predictable crises catch us by surprise -- and lays out some signs that there may be a charging rhino in your life right now.","slug":"michele_wucker_why_we_ignore_obvious_problems_and_how_to_act_on_them","recorded_at":"2019-02-21 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-05-01 14:48:23","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:31:54","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":589,"name":"TED Salon U.S. Air Force"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4e7d8eaa39b1d60a80b71bcffde131d60a89c68f_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4e7d8eaa39b1d60a80b71bcffde131d60a89c68f_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4e7d8eaa39b1d60a80b71bcffde131d60a89c68f_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/4e7d8eaa39b1d60a80b71bcffde131d60a89c68f_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/879a5339fdadb0176983136e78980c5499c9d798_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4991678,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13816014,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24469073,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34522005,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46263289,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72574714,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":112033678,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5205899,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34687954,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72711151,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6194469,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14070609,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MicheleWucker_2019S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72708939,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"decision-making"},{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"finance"},{"tag":"personal growth"},{"tag":"psychology"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5121,"name":"Michele Wucker"}}],"ratings":[]}}
