{"talk":{"id":81405,"name":"Lizzo: The Black history of twerking -- and how it taught me self-love","description":"Twerking is mainstream now ... but do you know where it came from? Superstar Lizzo traces booty shaking to a traditional West African dance and tells how Black women across generations kept the rhythm alive, from blues and jazz singers to modern rap and hip-hop performers. With her characteristic energy, she shares how twerking empowered her to love her own body -- and explains why understanding its origins helps protect Black culture from erasure and misappropriation. (And, yes, she twerks on stage.)","slug":"lizzo_the_black_history_of_twerking_and_how_it_taught_me_self_love","recorded_at":"2021-08-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-10-01 16:00:09","updated_at":"2021-10-29 16:54:52","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":724,"name":"TEDMonterey"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1911e7ce391f6b0758a546b6377547919cdee972_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1911e7ce391f6b0758a546b6377547919cdee972_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1911e7ce391f6b0758a546b6377547919cdee972_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1911e7ce391f6b0758a546b6377547919cdee972_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/e98b941eb01d28af7255795df2909d5e5730845f_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6834985,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18961439,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":33583482,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47284839,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":63285753,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":99448707,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":153933907,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7049276,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47450631,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":99585150,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/Lizzo_2021.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7318497,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"languages":{"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"dance"},{"tag":"entertainment"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"music"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6406,"name":"Lizzo"}}],"ratings":[]}}
