{"talk":{"id":9296,"name":"Karen Lloyd: This deep-sea mystery is changing our understanding of life","description":"How deep into the Earth can we go and still find life? Marine microbiologist Karen Lloyd introduces us to deep-subsurface microbes: tiny organisms that live buried meters deep in ocean mud and have been on Earth since way before animals.
