{"talk":{"id":2635,"name":"Tiq Milan and Kim Katrin Milan: A queer vision of love and marriage","description":"Love is a tool for revolutionary change and a path toward inclusivity and understanding for the LGBTQ+ community.

day.","slug":"tiq_milan_and_kim_katrin_milan_a_queer_vision_of_love_and_marriage","recorded_at":"2016-10-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-12-05 16:24:27","updated_at":"2021-04-09
