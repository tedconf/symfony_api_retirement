{"talk":{"id":2841,"name":"Tom Gruber: How AI can enhance our memory, work and social lives","description":"How smart can our machines make us? Tom Gruber, co-creator of Siri, wants to make \"humanistic AI\" that augments and collaborates with us instead of competing with (or replacing) us. He shares his vision for a future where AI helps us achieve superhuman performance in perception, creativity and cognitive function -- from turbocharging our design skills to helping us remember everything we've ever read and the name of everyone we've ever met. \"We are in the middle of a renaissance in AI,\" Gruber says. \"Every time a machine gets smarter, we get smarter.\"","slug":"tom_gruber_how_ai_can_enhance_our_memory_work_and_social_lives","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-08-07 14:39:10","updated_at":"2021-04-13
