{"talk":{"id":1707,"name":"Skylar Tibbits: The emergence of \"4D printing\"","description":"3D printing has grown in sophistication since the late 1970s; TED Fellow Skylar Tibbits is shaping the next development, which he calls 4D printing, where the fourth dimension is time. This emerging technology will allow us to print objects that then reshape themselves or self-assemble over time. Think: a printed cube that folds before your eyes, or a printed pipe able to sense the need to expand or contract.","slug":"skylar_tibbits_the_emergence_of_4d_printing","recorded_at":"2013-02-25 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-04-04 14:56:21","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:46:51","viewed_count":2713009,"emailed_count":168,"event":{"id":181,"name":"TED2013"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5067e7078880030b41aea9eb2b6fbddbdedc7728_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5067e7078880030b41aea9eb2b6fbddbdedc7728_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5067e7078880030b41aea9eb2b6fbddbdedc7728_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"1600x1200","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/5067e7078880030b41aea9eb2b6fbddbdedc7728_1600x1200.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4136097,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11393127,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20178810,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28489565,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38233498,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58470911,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90510367,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4269620,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28604751,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58480889,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5219584,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11642676,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SkylarTibbits_2013U-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58486019,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"industrial design"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":77,"name":"Talks from TED Fellows"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1084,"name":"Skylar Tibbits"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":297}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":255}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":362}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":159}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":185}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":89}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":72}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":41}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":17}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":23}}]}}
