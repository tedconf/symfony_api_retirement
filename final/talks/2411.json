{"talk":{"id":2411,"name":"Oscar Schwartz: Can a computer write poetry?","description":"If you read a poem and feel moved by it, but then find out it was actually written by a computer, would you feel differently about the experience? Would you think that the computer had expressed itself and been creative, or would you feel like you had fallen for a cheap trick? In this talk, writer Oscar Schwartz examines why we react so strongly to the idea of a computer writing poetry -- and how this reaction helps us understand what it means to be human.","slug":"oscar_schwartz_can_a_computer_write_poetry","recorded_at":"2015-05-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-01-20 16:06:06","updated_at":"2021-04-09
