{"talk":{"id":12202,"name":"Ndidi Nwuneli: The role of faith and belief in modern Africa","description":"Ndidi Nwuneli has advice for Africans who believe in God -- and Africans who don't. To the religious, she advises against using God to outsource responsibility for what happens in their lives. To the non-religious, she asks that they keep an open mind and work with faith-based organizations, especially on issues like health care and education. \"There's so much potential that can be realized when we walk across the divide of faith and, hand in hand, try to solve many of our problems,\" Nwuneli
