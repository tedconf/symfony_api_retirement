{"talk":{"id":10173,"name":"Bhu Srinivasan: Capitalism isn't an ideology -- it's an operating system","description":"Bhu Srinivasan researches the intersection of capitalism and technological progress.

Learn more about the past and future of the free market (and a potential coming identity crisis for the United States' version of capitalism) with this quick, forward-thinking talk.","slug":"bhu_srinivasan_capitalism_isn_t_an_ideology_it_s_an_operating_system","recorded_at":"2017-10-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-02-12 15:43:09","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:29:41","viewed_count":1074943,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":547,"name":"TED Salon Brightline Initiative"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/96fb8c93fbc329851873b6b37ac03abf4376477f_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/96fb8c93fbc329851873b6b37ac03abf4376477f_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/96fb8c93fbc329851873b6b37ac03abf4376477f_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/96fb8c93fbc329851873b6b37ac03abf4376477f_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/17f19d2c4b6d71f2afa05f5197b920ac96f10746_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3080049,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8456838,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14967809,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21116896,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28215499,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":44765914,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":68416253,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3339015,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21636011,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45024388,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3792249,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8704784,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BhuSrinivasan_2017S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45033544,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"ur":{"name":"Urdu"}},"tags":[{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"capitalism"},{"tag":"drones"},{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"politics"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3683,"name":"Bhu Srinivasan"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":181}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":38}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":37}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":35}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":54}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":38}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":20}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":48}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":2}}]}}
