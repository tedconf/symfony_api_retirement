{"talk":{"id":66948,"name":"Myles Allen: Fossil fuel companies know how to stop global warming. Why don't they?","description":"The fossil fuel industry knows how to stop global warming, but they're waiting for someone else to pay, says climate science scholar Myles Allen. Instead of a total ban on carbon-emitting fuels, Allen puts forth a bold plan for oil and gas companies to progressively decarbonize themselves and sequester CO2 deep in the earth, with the aim of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and creating a carbon dioxide disposal industry that works for everyone.","slug":"myles_allen_fossil_fuel_companies_know_how_to_stop_global_warming_why_don_t_they","recorded_at":"2020-10-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-12-04 21:05:37","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:43:15","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":620,"name":"Countdown"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2f50434135f4ec32331e7b154ef5cc689bd533b3_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2f50434135f4ec32331e7b154ef5cc689bd533b3_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2f50434135f4ec32331e7b154ef5cc689bd533b3_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2f50434135f4ec32331e7b154ef5cc689bd533b3_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cc1b058234d43f9dbff70f965ceef03c7e1ebfdf_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5296821,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14662311,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":25928461,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36495823,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":48679807,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":75006400,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":116160035,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5555376,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37014999,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":75283059,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6810437,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14915625,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MylesAllen_2020T-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":75293656,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Countdown"},{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"energy"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"fossil fuels"},{"tag":"leadership"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6088,"name":"Myles Allen"}}],"ratings":[]}}
