{"talk":{"id":1666,"name":"Shabana Basij-Rasikh: Dare to educate Afghan girls","description":"Imagine a country where girls must sneak out to go to school, with deadly consequences if they get caught learning. This was Afghanistan under the Taliban, and traces of that danger remain today. 22-year-old Shabana Basij-Rasikh runs a school for girls in Afghanistan. She celebrates the power of a family's decision to believe in their daughters -- and tells the story of one brave father who stood up to local threats.","slug":"shabana_basij_rasikh_dare_to_educate_afghan_girls","recorded_at":"2012-12-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-02-11 16:08:19","updated_at":"2020-09-28
