{"talk":{"id":2477,"name":"Hugh Evans: What does it mean to be a citizen of the world?","description":"Hugh Evans started a movement that mobilizes \"global citizens,\" people who self-identify first and foremost not as members of a state, nation or tribe but as members of the human race. In this uplifting and personal talk, learn more about how this new understanding of our place in the world is galvanizing people to take action in the fights against extreme poverty, climate change, gender inequality and more. \"These are ultimately global issues,\" Evans says, \"and they can only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.\"","slug":"hugh_evans_what_does_it_mean_to_be_a_citizen_of_the_world","recorded_at":"2016-02-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-04-11 12:24:34","updated_at":"2021-04-13
