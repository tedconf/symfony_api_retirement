{"talk":{"id":3269,"name":"Elif Shafak: The revolutionary power of diverse thought","description":"\"From populist demagogues, we will learn the indispensability of democracy,\" says novelist Elif Shafak. \"From isolationists, we will learn the need for global solidarity. And from tribalists, we will learn the beauty of cosmopolitanism.\" A native of Turkey, Shafak has experienced firsthand the devastation that a loss of diversity can bring -- and she knows the revolutionary power of plurality in response to authoritarianism.
