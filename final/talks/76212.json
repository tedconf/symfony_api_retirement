{"talk":{"id":76212,"name":"Jorge Ma\u00f1es Rubio: What should humans take to space (and leave behind)?","description":"One day, humans will explore space en masse and live scattered across the solar system on planets like Mars and beyond. Inspired by his time as artist-in-residence at the European Space Agency, TED Fellow Jorge Ma\u00f1es Rubio wants to rethink what we need to bring on this grand journey -- and more importantly, what we should leave behind. Ma\u00f1es Rubio takes us on an Earthbound journey through cultural practices and his own designs that blend science, art and ritual, encouraging a bold reimagining of what a future free of prejudice and exploitation could look like.","slug":"jorge_manes_rubio_what_should_humans_take_to_space_and_leave_behind","recorded_at":"2021-05-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-07-07 13:21:21","updated_at":"2021-10-22 08:44:35","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":713,"name":"TED Fellows: Shape Your Future"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb3088a5b6468e6feefb4f1cca1d47134856e719_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb3088a5b6468e6feefb4f1cca1d47134856e719_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb3088a5b6468e6feefb4f1cca1d47134856e719_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/cb3088a5b6468e6feefb4f1cca1d47134856e719_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/f5ee1924bab406d61ef6824cc3e5814b9d745921_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4594408,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12699374,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22504548,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31748117,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42583053,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65286295,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":101316339,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4808538,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31914160,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65440952,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5687691,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12958489,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JorgeManesRubio_2020F-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":65445621,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Moon"},{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"ancient world"},{"tag":"art"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"indigenous peoples"},{"tag":"space"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1824,"name":"Jorge Man\u0303es Rubio"}}],"ratings":[]}}
