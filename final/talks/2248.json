{"talk":{"id":2248,"name":"Dawn Landes: A song for my hero, the woman who rowed into a hurricane","description":"Singer-songwriter Dawn Landes tells the story of Tori Murden McClure, who dreamed of rowing across the Atlantic in a small boat -- but whose dream was almost capsized by waves the size of a seven-story building. Through video, story and song, Landes imagines the mindset of a woman alone in the midst of the vast ocean. (This talk was part of a session at TED2015 guest-curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com or @popupmag on Twitter.)","slug":"dawn_landes_a_song_for_my_hero_the_woman_who_rowed_into_a_hurricane","recorded_at":"2015-03-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-05-08 15:14:35","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:37:26","viewed_count":1295845,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":336,"name":"TED2015"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ebf07de6852c5ea80c9fa90a0f3873ac7b6f5106_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ebf07de6852c5ea80c9fa90a0f3873ac7b6f5106_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ebf07de6852c5ea80c9fa90a0f3873ac7b6f5106_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ebf07de6852c5ea80c9fa90a0f3873ac7b6f5106_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/75b9ae338b2674529407bbbbd583d36013ce8a0a_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4668700,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12914872,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":22888941,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32296984,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43298112,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67876695,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":104741496,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4802142,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32412307,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67869020,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5987570,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13167861,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DawnLandes_2015-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67874662,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"fr-ca":{"name":"French (Canada)"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"lt":{"name":"Lithuanian"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"entertainment"},{"tag":"music"},{"tag":"performance"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":17,"name":"Art Unusual"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2448,"name":"Dawn Landes"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":301}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":84}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":25}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":189}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":42}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":285}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":266}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":36}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":17}}]}}
