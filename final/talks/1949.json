{"talk":{"id":1949,"name":"Charmian Gooch: My wish: To launch a new era of openness in business","description":"Anonymous companies protect corrupt individuals \u2013 from notorious drug cartel leaders to nefarious arms dealers \u2013 behind a shroud of mystery that makes it almost impossible to find and hold them responsible. But anti-corruption activist Charmian Gooch hopes to change all that. At TED2014, she shares her brave TED Prize wish: to know who owns and controls companies, to change the law, and to launch a new era of openness in business.","slug":"charmian_gooch_my_wish_to_launch_a_new_era_of_openness_in_business","recorded_at":"2014-03-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2014-03-20 15:14:01","updated_at":"2020-09-28
