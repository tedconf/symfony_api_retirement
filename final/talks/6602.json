{"talk":{"id":6602,"name":"Naoko Ishii: An economic case for protecting the planet","description":"We all share one planet -- we breathe the same air, drink the same water and depend on the same oceans, forests and biodiversity. Economist Naoko Ishii is on a mission to protect these shared resources, known as the global commons, that are vital for our survival. In an eye-opening talk about the wellness of the planet, Ishii outlines four economic systems we need to change to safeguard the global commons, making the case for a new kind of social contract with the earth.","slug":"naoko_ishii_an_economic_case_for_protecting_the_planet","recorded_at":"2017-09-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-22 15:56:34","updated_at":"2021-04-09
