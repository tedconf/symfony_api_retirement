{"talk":{"id":2164,"name":"Fredy Peccerelli: A forensic anthropologist who brings closure for the\u00a0\"disappeared\"","description":"In Guatemala's 36-year conflict, 200,000 civilians were killed \u2014 and more than 40,000 were never identified. At the Forensic Anthropology Foundation of Guatemala, Fredy Peccerelli and his team use DNA, archeology and storytelling to help families find the bodies of their loved ones. It's a sobering task, but it can bring peace of mind \u2014 and sometimes, justice.
