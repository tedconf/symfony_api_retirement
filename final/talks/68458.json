{"talk":{"id":68458,"name":"Michael Levin: The electrical blueprints that orchestrate life","description":"DNA isn't the only builder in the biological world -- there's also a mysterious bioelectric layer directing cells to work together to grow organs, systems and bodies, says biologist Michael Levin. Sharing unforgettable and groundbreaking footage of two-headed worms, he introduces us to xenobots -- the world's first living robots, created in his lab by cracking the electrical code of cells -- and discusses what this discovery may mean for the future of medicine, the environment and even life itself. (This conversation, hosted by TED's Chris Anderson, was recorded June 2020.)","slug":"michael_levin_the_electrical_blueprints_that_orchestrate_life","recorded_at":"2020-05-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-03-31 18:02:53","updated_at":"2021-10-22 20:58:34","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d2f6feb026baa156d7059ff062024f50922dae37_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d2f6feb026baa156d7059ff062024f50922dae37_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d2f6feb026baa156d7059ff062024f50922dae37_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d2f6feb026baa156d7059ff062024f50922dae37_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/3269198e3f8f531186766b8efd1871cd717649ce_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9654592,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26823116,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":47400916,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":66611600,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":88812230,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":137332983,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":214422668,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9912992,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67130926,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/MichaelLevin_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":137609644,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"DNA"},{"tag":"biology"},{"tag":"engineering"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"invention"},{"tag":"nature"},{"tag":"robots"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5843,"name":"Michael Levin"}},{"speaker":{"id":187,"name":"Chris Anderson"}}],"ratings":[]}}
