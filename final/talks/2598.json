{"talk":{"id":2598,"name":"Pico Iyer: The beauty of what we'll never know","description":"Almost 30 years ago, Pico Iyer took a trip to Japan, fell in love with the country and moved there. A keen observer of the human spirit, Iyer professes that he now feels he knows far less about Japan -- or, indeed, about anything -- than he thought he knew three decades ago. In this lyrical meditation on wisdom, Iyer expands on this curious insight about knowledge gained with age: that the more we know, the more we see how little we know.","slug":"pico_iyer_the_beauty_of_what_we_ll_never_know","recorded_at":"2016-06-30 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-10-11 15:10:36","updated_at":"2021-04-09
