{"talk":{"id":40636,"name":"Ivan Poupyrev: Everything around you can become a computer","description":"Designer Ivan Poupyrev wants to integrate technology into everyday objects to make them more useful and fun -- like a jacket you can use to answer phone calls or a houseplant you can play like a keyboard. In a talk and tech demo, he lays out his vision for a physical world that's more deeply connected to the internet and shows how, with a little collaboration, we can get there. Unveiled in this talk: Poupyrev announces that his newest device, Jacquard, is now publicly available for all designers to use.","slug":"ivan_poupyrev_everything_around_you_can_become_a_computer","recorded_at":"2019-04-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-05-06 15:00:20","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:29:50","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":597,"name":"TED2019"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/68a9a812b828ed60fc4bc6e178aaf0ef3b13fd84_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/68a9a812b828ed60fc4bc6e178aaf0ef3b13fd84_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/68a9a812b828ed60fc4bc6e178aaf0ef3b13fd84_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/68a9a812b828ed60fc4bc6e178aaf0ef3b13fd84_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/0c962bda5750965148c6ef18752172c921f5b14c_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6516405,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18060737,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":32000082,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45097359,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":60344330,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77164561,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":146609576,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6730529,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":45263418,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":94855691,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":18317112,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/IvanPoupyrev_2019-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":94846891,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Internet"},{"tag":"UX design"},{"tag":"code"},{"tag":"collaboration"},{"tag":"computers"},{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"demo"},{"tag":"design"},{"tag":"engineering"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"invention"},{"tag":"potential"},{"tag":"product design"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5135,"name":"Ivan Poupyrev"}}],"ratings":[]}}
