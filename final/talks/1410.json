{"talk":{"id":1410,"name":"Chip Kidd: Designing books is no laughing matter. OK, it is.","description":"Chip Kidd doesn't judge books by their cover, he creates covers that embody the book -- and he does it with a wicked sense of humor. In this deeply felt (and deeply hilarious) talk, he shares the art and the philosophy behind his cover designs. (This talk is from The Design Studio session at TED2012, guest-curated by Chee Pearlman and David Rockwell.)","slug":"chip_kidd_designing_books_is_no_laughing_matter_ok_it_is","recorded_at":"2012-03-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-04-04 15:16:25","updated_at":"2020-09-28
