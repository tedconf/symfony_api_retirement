{"talk":{"id":2871,"name":"Jun Wang: How digital DNA could help you make better health choices","description":"What if you could know exactly how food or medication would impact your health -- before you put it in your body? Genomics researcher Jun Wang is working to develop digital doppelgangers for real people; they start with genetic code, but they'll also factor in other kinds of data as well, from food intake to sleep to data collected by a \"smart toilet.\" With all of this valuable information, Wang hopes to create an engine that will change the way we think about health, both on an individual level and as a collective.","slug":"jun_wang_how_digital_dna_could_help_you_make_better_health_choices","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-09-18 15:14:47","updated_at":"2020-09-28
