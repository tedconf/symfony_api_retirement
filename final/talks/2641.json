{"talk":{"id":2641,"name":"Elizabeth Lesser: Say your truths and seek them in others","description":"In a lyrical, unexpectedly funny talk about heavy topics such as frayed relationships and the death of a loved one, Elizabeth Lesser describes the healing process of putting aside pride and defensiveness to make way for soul-baring and truth-telling. \"You don't have to wait for a life-or-death situation to clean up the relationships that matter to you,\" she says. \"Be like a new kind of first responder ... the one to take the first courageous step toward the other.\"","slug":"elizabeth_lesser_say_your_truths_and_seek_them_in_others","recorded_at":"2016-10-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-12-08 16:18:05","updated_at":"2021-04-09
