{"talk":{"id":2423,"name":"Dambisa Moyo: Economic growth has stalled. Let's fix it","description":"Economic growth is the defining challenge of our time; without it, political and social instability rises, human progress stagnates and societies grow dimmer. But, says economist Dambisa Moyo, dogmatic capitalism isn't creating the growth we need. As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth.","slug":"dambisa_moyo_economic_growth_has_stalled_let_s_fix_it","recorded_at":"2015-12-08 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-02-08 16:08:22","updated_at":"2021-04-09
