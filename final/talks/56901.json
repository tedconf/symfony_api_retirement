{"talk":{"id":56901,"name":"Lucy King: How bees can keep the peace between elephants and humans","description":"Imagine waking in the middle of the night to an elephant ripping the roof from your house in search of food. This is a reality in some communities in Africa where, as wild spaces shrink, people and elephants are competing for space and resources like never before.
