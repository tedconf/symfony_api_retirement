{"talk":{"id":2498,"name":"Sangeeta Bhatia: This tiny particle could roam your body to find tumors","description":"What if we could find cancerous tumors years before they can harm us -- without expensive screening facilities or even steady electricity? Physician, bioengineer and entrepreneur Sangeeta Bhatia leads a multidisciplinary lab that searches for novel ways to understand, diagnose and treat human disease. Her target: the two-thirds of deaths due to cancer that she says are fully preventable. With remarkable clarity, she breaks down complex nanoparticle science and shares her dream for a radical new cancer test that could save millions of lives.","slug":"sangeeta_bhatia_this_tiny_particle_could_roam_your_body_to_find_tumors","recorded_at":"2015-11-06 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-05-12 15:05:29","updated_at":"2021-04-09
