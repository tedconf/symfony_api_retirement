{"talk":{"id":1160,"name":"Aaron O'Connell: Making sense of a visible quantum object","description":"Physicists are used to the idea that subatomic particles behave according to the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics, completely different to human-scale objects. In a breakthrough experiment, Aaron O'Connell has blurred that distinction by creating an object that is visible to the unaided eye, but provably in two places at the same time. In this talk he suggests an intriguing way of thinking about the result.","slug":"aaron_o_connell_making_sense_of_a_visible_quantum_object","recorded_at":"2011-03-02
