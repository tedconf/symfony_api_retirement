{"talk":{"id":14439,"name":"Jaron Lanier: How we need to remake the internet","description":"In the early days of digital culture, Jaron Lanier helped craft a vision for the internet as public commons where humanity could share its knowledge -- but even then, this vision was haunted by the dark side of how it could turn out: with personal devices that control our lives, monitor our data and feed us stimuli. (Sound familiar?) In this visionary talk, Lanier reflects on a \"globally tragic, astoundingly ridiculous mistake\" companies like Google and Facebook made at the foundation of digital culture -- and how we can undo it. \"We cannot have a society in which, if two people wish to communicate, the only way that can happen is if it's financed by a third person who wishes to manipulate them,\" he says.","slug":"jaron_lanier_how_we_need_to_remake_the_internet","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-12 15:57:46","updated_at":"2021-04-13
