{"talk":{"id":66344,"name":"Liene Ozoli\u0146a: Why do we blame individuals for economic crises?","description":"In 2008, the global financial crisis decimated Latvia. As unemployment skyrocketed, the government slashed public funding and raised taxes, while providing relief to the wealthy and large businesses -- all without backlash or protest from struggling citizens.
