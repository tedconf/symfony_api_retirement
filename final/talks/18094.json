{"talk":{"id":18094,"name":"Prosanta Chakrabarty: Four billion years of evolution in six minutes","description":"Did humans evolve from monkeys or from fish? In this enlightening talk, ichthyologist and TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty dispels some hardwired myths about evolution, encouraging us to remember that we're a small part of a complex, four-billion-year process -- and not the end of the line. \"We're not the goal of evolution,\" Chakrabarty says. \"Think of us all as young leaves on this ancient and gigantic tree of life -- connected by invisible branches not just to each other, but to our extinct relatives and our evolutionary ancestors.\"","slug":"prosanta_chakrabarty_four_billion_years_of_evolution_in_six_minutes","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-06-15 14:54:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
