{"talk":{"id":9125,"name":"Anjali Kumar: My failed mission to find God -- and what I found instead","description":"Anjali Kumar went looking for God and ended up finding something else entirely. In an uplifting, funny talk about our shared humanity, she takes us on a spiritual pilgrimage to meet witches in New York, a shaman in Peru, an infamous \"healer\" in Brazil and others, sharing an important lesson: what binds us together is far stronger than what separates us, and our differences are not insurmountable.","slug":"anjali_kumar_my_failed_mission_to_find_god_and_what_i_found_instead","recorded_at":"2017-11-02 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-31 15:55:01","updated_at":"2021-04-09
