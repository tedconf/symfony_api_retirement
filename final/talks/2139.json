{"talk":{"id":2139,"name":"Robert Muggah: How to protect fast-growing cities from failing","description":"Worldwide, violence is on the decline, but in the crowded cities of the global south \u2014 cities like Aleppo, Bamako and Caracas \u2014 violence is actually accelerating, fueled by the drug trade, mass unemployment and civil unrest.

He shows us the four big risks we face, and offers a way to change course.","slug":"robert_muggah_how_to_protect_fast_growing_cities_from_failing","recorded_at":"2014-10-13 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-01-15 15:56:51","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:46:01","viewed_count":964426,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":324,"name":"TEDGlobal 2014"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6525b81229e98b9e8d9c0f404e6c95141eb329f1_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6525b81229e98b9e8d9c0f404e6c95141eb329f1_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6525b81229e98b9e8d9c0f404e6c95141eb329f1_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6525b81229e98b9e8d9c0f404e6c95141eb329f1_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/8cba1467d7011da819a9ea1860eaef66d79c8a41_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7318909,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20297607,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":35948777,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50626138,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67701045,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":106187095,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":164632154,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7452454,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":50741313,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":106179027,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9201947,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20543012,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobertMuggah_2014G-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":106197140,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"ca":{"name":"Catalan"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"cities"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"infrastructure"},{"tag":"violence"},{"tag":"war"},{"tag":"youth"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":50,"name":"War and Peace"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2049,"name":"Robert Muggah"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":26}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":192}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":81}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":139}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":191}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":20}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":230}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":234}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":45}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":41}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":170}}]}}
