{"talk":{"id":4669,"name":"Mariano Sigman and Dan Ariely: How can groups make good decisions?","description":"We all know that when we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right -- and sometimes they go very wrong. How can groups make good decisions? With his colleague Dan Ariely, neuroscientist Mariano Sigman has been inquiring into how we interact to reach decisions by performing experiments with live crowds around the world. In this fun, fact-filled explainer, he shares some intriguing results -- as well as some implications for how it might impact our political system. In a time when people seem to be more polarized than ever, Sigman says, better understanding how groups interact and reach conclusions might spark interesting new ways to construct a healthier democracy.","slug":"mariano_sigman_and_dan_ariely_how_can_groups_make_good_decisions","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-11-22 15:58:21","updated_at":"2021-12-15
