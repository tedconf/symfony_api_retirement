{"talk":{"id":2566,"name":"Sarah Parcak: Hunting for Peru's lost civilizations -- with satellites","description":"Around the world, hundreds of thousands of lost ancient sites lie buried and hidden from view. Satellite archaeologist Sarah Parcak is determined to find them before looters do. With the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak is building an online citizen-science tool called GlobalXplorer that will train an army of volunteer explorers to find and protect the world's hidden heritage. In this talk, she offers a preview of the first place they'll look: Peru -- the home of Machu Picchu, the Nazca lines and other archaeological wonders waiting to be discovered.","slug":"sarah_parcak_hunting_for_peru_s_lost_civilizations_with_satellites","recorded_at":"2016-06-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-08-17 15:07:50","updated_at":"2021-04-09
