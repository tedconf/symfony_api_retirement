{"talk":{"id":1688,"name":"Dan Pallotta: The way we think about charity is dead wrong","description":"Activist and fundraiser Dan Pallotta calls out the double standard that drives our broken relationship to charities. Too many nonprofits, he says, are rewarded for how little they spend -- not for what they get done.
