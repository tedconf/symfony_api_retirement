{"talk":{"id":6594,"name":"Christopher Ategeka: How adoption worked for me","description":"Talent is universal, but opportunity isn't, says TED Fellow Christopher Ategeka. In this charming, hopeful talk, Ategeka tells his story of being orphaned at a young age -- and how being adopted gave him the chance to experience a new culture, acquire an education and live up to his full potential. \"We may not be able to solve the bigotry and the racism of this world today,\" Ategeka says, \"But certainly we can raise children to create a positive, inclusive, connected world full of empathy, love and compassion.\"","slug":"christopher_ategeka_how_adoption_worked_for_me","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-02 15:42:55","updated_at":"2021-04-09
