But there's another kind that's just as deadly and harder to detect because the symptoms are silent. In this quick talk, 17-year-old inventor Akash Manoj shares the device he's developed to stop this silent killer: a noninvasive, inexpensive, wearable patch that alerts patients during a critical moment that could mean the difference between life and death.","slug":"akash_manoj_a_life_saving_device_that_detects_silent_heart_attacks","recorded_at":"2018-11-17 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-01-17 20:45:41","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:30:58","viewed_count":1259160,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":448,"name":"TED-Ed Weekend"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fc398e52b43cd3e48fb34ef647524938e4009bce_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fc398e52b43cd3e48fb34ef647524938e4009bce_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fc398e52b43cd3e48fb34ef647524938e4009bce_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fc398e52b43cd3e48fb34ef647524938e4009bce_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/78e54a8f436b41511fe63bbd1574ebe6539a5d6d_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4073866,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11215490,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19882372,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28078250,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37683256,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":59030491,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90980465,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4288254,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28244262,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":59167124,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5014776,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11469920,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/AkashManoj_2018Y-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":59168036,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"sq":{"name":"Albanian"},"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ku":{"name":"Kurdish"},"ckb":{"name":"Kurdish (Central)"},"mr":{"name":"Marathi"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"sk":{"name":"Slovak"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED-Ed"},{"tag":"heart"},{"tag":"invention"},{"tag":"medical research"},{"tag":"science"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":4957,"name":"Akash Manoj"}}],"ratings":[]}}
