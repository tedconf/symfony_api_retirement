{"talk":{"id":2120,"name":"Debra Jarvis: Yes, I survived cancer. But that doesn't define me","description":"Debra Jarvis had worked as a hospital chaplain for nearly 30 years when she was diagnosed with cancer. And she learned quite a bit as a patient. In a witty, daring talk, she explains how the identity of \u201ccancer survivor\u201d can feel static. She asks us all to claim our hardest experiences, while giving ourselves room to grow and evolve.","slug":"debra_jarvis_yes_i_survived_cancer_but_that_doesn_t_define_me","recorded_at":"2014-09-10
