{"talk":{"id":1356,"name":"Tyrone Hayes + Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: The toxic baby","description":"Filmmaker Penelope Jagessar Chaffer was curious about the chemicals she was exposed to while pregnant: Could they affect her unborn child? So she asked scientist Tyrone Hayes to brief her on one he studied closely: atrazine, a herbicide used on corn. (Hayes, an expert on amphibians, is a critic of atrazine, which displays a disturbing effect on frog development.) Onstage together at TEDWomen, Hayes and Chaffer tell their story.","slug":"tyrone_hayes_penelope_jagessar_chaffer_the_toxic_baby","recorded_at":"2010-12-02 00:00:00","published_at":"2012-02-13
