{"talk":{"id":2437,"name":"Magda Sayeg: How yarn bombing grew into a worldwide movement","description":"Textile artist Magda Sayeg transforms urban landscapes into her own playground by decorating everyday objects with colorful knit and crochet works. These warm, fuzzy \"yarn bombs\" started small, with stop sign poles and fire hydrants in Sayeg's hometown, but soon people found a connection to the craft and spread it across the world. \"We all

that are just waiting to be discovered.\"","slug":"magda_sayeg_how_yarn_bombing_grew_into_a_worldwide_movement","recorded_at":"2015-11-14 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-03-01
