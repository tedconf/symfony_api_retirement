{"talk":{"id":1708,"name":"Ken Jennings: Watson, Jeopardy and me, the obsolete know-it-all","description":"Trivia whiz Ken Jennings has made a career as a keeper of facts; he holds the longest winning streak in history on the US quiz show Jeopardy. But in 2011, he played a challenge match against IBM's supercomputer Watson -- and lost. With humor and humility, Jennings tells us how it felt to have a computer literally beat him at his own game, and makes the case for good old-fashioned human knowledge.","slug":"ken_jennings_watson_jeopardy_and_me_the_obsolete_know_it_all","recorded_at":"2013-02-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-04-05 15:22:43","updated_at":"2020-09-28
