{"talk":{"id":59801,"name":"Jill Seubert: How a miniaturized atomic clock could revolutionize space exploration","description":"Ask any deep space navigator like Jill Seubert what makes steering a spacecraft difficult, and they'll tell you it's all about the timing; a split-second can decide a mission's success or failure. So what do you do when a spacecraft is bad at telling time? You get it a clock -- an atomic clock, to be precise. Let Seubert whisk you away with the revolutionary potential of a future where you could receive stellar, GPS-like directions -- no matter where you are in the universe.","slug":"jill_seubert_how_a_miniaturized_atomic_clock_could_revolutionize_space_exploration","recorded_at":"2019-05-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-03-05 16:09:50","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:33:50","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":627,"name":"TEDxUCLA"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/349ac4c79d07eb49492465cc3d0822be082af21b_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/349ac4c79d07eb49492465cc3d0822be082af21b_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/349ac4c79d07eb49492465cc3d0822be082af21b_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/349ac4c79d07eb49492465cc3d0822be082af21b_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/93c962bf16fb279d2058f6052b915e0314ca0531_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5601418,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15511287,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":27481096,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38737152,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":51873468,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":79695183,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":123889290,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5815583,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38903131,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":79849771,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6872082,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15775600,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JillSeubert_2019X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":79851058,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Mars"},{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"exploration"},{"tag":"space"},{"tag":"time"},{"tag":"universe"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5903,"name":"Jill Seubert"}}],"ratings":[]}}
