{"talk":{"id":211,"name":"Chris Anderson: TED's nonprofit transition","description":"Chris Anderson gave this talk in 2002, prior to taking over leadership of TED. Co-founder Richard Saul Wurman was leaving, and TED's future was in the balance. He seeks to persuade TEDsters that what was then a for-profit conference had a secure future as an idea-based nonprofit endeavor.","slug":"chris_anderson_ted_s_nonprofit_transition","recorded_at":"2002-02-02 00:00:00","published_at":"2008-01-30 01:57:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:48:15","viewed_count":346524,"emailed_count":195,"event":{"id":7,"name":"TED2002"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/27581_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/27581_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"480x360","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/27581_480x360.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":false,"media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6336675,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17568543,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":31059759,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43559080,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":57956103,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":89770305,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":141564069,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6436497,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43833684,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90023573,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ChrisAnderson_2002-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17710036,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"business"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"global issues"},{"tag":"philanthropy"},{"tag":"philosophy"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":28,"name":"Not Business as Usual"}},{"theme":{"id":55,"name":"Media With Meaning"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":187,"name":"Chris Anderson"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":139}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":110}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":274}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":46}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":37}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":111}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":45}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":61}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":20}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":10}}]}}
