{"talk":{"id":64824,"name":"D-L Stewart: Scenes from a Black trans life","description":"At the crossroads of life and livelihood, scholar D-L Stewart invites us into scenes from his own life as he resists and reflects on the dehumanizing narratives that shape the Black trans experience in the US. With each word of his captivating and poetic dissection, Stewart emphasizes the magnitude and urgency of the rallying cry \"Black trans lives matter\" -- and calls on others to uphold that truth, too.","slug":"d_l_stewart_scenes_from_a_black_trans_life","recorded_at":"2019-03-09 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-07-02 15:41:04","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:38:44","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":517,"name":"TEDxCSU"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1cf72254c3986589a908f1d7f68cccb584b38e05_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1cf72254c3986589a908f1d7f68cccb584b38e05_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1cf72254c3986589a908f1d7f68cccb584b38e05_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/1cf72254c3986589a908f1d7f68cccb584b38e05_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ecb16df00ae80d39812bada6f46d215d25bd48e7_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7564807,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20991558,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37127511,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52194289,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":69608707,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":107737757,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":167801041,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7823308,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":52713432,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":108014486,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":9388717,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21236578,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/DLStewart_2019X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":108007932,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"Transgender"},{"tag":"gender"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"race"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":6039,"name":"D-L Stewart"}}],"ratings":[]}}
