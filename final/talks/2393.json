{"talk":{"id":2393,"name":"Alison Killing: What happens when a city runs out of room for its dead","description":"\"If you want to go out and start your own cemetery\" in the UK, says Alison Killing, \"you kind of can.\" She thinks a lot about where we die and are buried -- and in this talk, the architect and TED Fellow offers an eye-opening economic and social perspective on an overlooked feature of our towns and cities: the cemetery. Speaking specifically to UK laws, she unpacks the fascinating, sometimes funny, often contradictory laws about where you can be buried.","slug":"alison_killing_what_happens_when_a_city_runs_out_of_room_for_its_dead","recorded_at":"2014-11-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-12-16 17:06:47","updated_at":"2020-10-23
