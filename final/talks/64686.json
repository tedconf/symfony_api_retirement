{"talk":{"id":64686,"name":"Vishaan Chakrabarti: 3 ways we can redesign cities for equity and inclusion","description":"Cities are engines of culture, commerce, knowledge and community, but they're also centers of inequality and poverty. As the world rebuilds from the coronavirus pandemic, can we transform cities into bastions of equity and sustainability? Architect and educator Vishaan Chakrabarti discusses a new urban agenda that provides equitable housing, health care and transportation for all -- and helps build cities rooted in our desire to connect at a human level. \"We need a new narrative of generosity, not austerity,\" he says. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED arts and design curator Chee Pearlman and head of curation Helen Walters, was recorded June 10, 2020.)","slug":"vishaan_chakrabarti_3_ways_we_can_redesign_cities_for_equity_and_inclusion","recorded_at":"2020-05-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-06-29 14:51:33","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:44:29","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b82011a8b9274d5892a2a8e369f1010d7b6852ff_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b82011a8b9274d5892a2a8e369f1010d7b6852ff_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b82011a8b9274d5892a2a8e369f1010d7b6852ff_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/b82011a8b9274d5892a2a8e369f1010d7b6852ff_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/a875d7acce97a18ef4c2142ef937d85e52bb51d6_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13039592,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":36268320,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":64101935,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90030619,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":120000951,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":184792034,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":289044586,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13298052,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":90549942,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":185068837,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/VishaanChakrabarti_2020.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11207366,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"}}},"tags":[{"tag":"architecture"},{"tag":"cities"},{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"coronavirus"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"health care"},{"tag":"inclusion"},{"tag":"policy"},{"tag":"urban planning"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3952,"name":"Vishaan Chakrabarti"}},{"speaker":{"id":1146,"name":"Chee Pearlman"}},{"speaker":{"id":4909,"name":"Helen Walters"}}],"ratings":[]}}
