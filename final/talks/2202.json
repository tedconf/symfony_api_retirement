{"talk":{"id":2202,"name":"Jon Gosier: The problem with \"trickle-down techonomics\"","description":"Hooray for technology! It makes everything better for everyone!! Right? Well, no. When a new technology, like ebooks or health trackers, is only available to some people, it has unintended consequences for all of us. Jon Gosier, a TED Fellow and tech investor, calls out the idea of \"trickle-down techonomics,\" and shares powerful examples of how new tech can make things actually worse if it's not equally distributed. As he says, \"the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone.\"","slug":"jon_gosier_the_problem_with_trickle_down_techonomics","recorded_at":"2014-10-16 00:00:00","published_at":"2015-03-02 16:29:22","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:45:25","viewed_count":812326,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":324,"name":"TEDGlobal 2014"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95d2642268566f6c0dbccaeca4d9a607d1d6c8c6_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95d2642268566f6c0dbccaeca4d9a607d1d6c8c6_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95d2642268566f6c0dbccaeca4d9a607d1d6c8c6_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95d2642268566f6c0dbccaeca4d9a607d1d6c8c6_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/ef8d3eec5a58b4e62fa2bcc37b3081c8b9622a13_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3026103,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8329245,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14788091,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20941072,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28163964,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43962017,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":67434605,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3159572,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21056360,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43954089,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8574028,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/JonGosier_2014U-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43945996,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bn":{"name":"Bengali"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"cs":{"name":"Czech"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hi":{"name":"Hindi"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[{"theme":{"id":6,"name":"What's Next in Tech"}}],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2254,"name":"Jon Gosier"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":238}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":156}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":103}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":60}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":36}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":5}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":31}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":38}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":7}}]}}
