{"talk":{"id":2521,"name":"Negin Farsad: A highly scientific taxonomy of haters","description":"TED Fellow Negin Farsad weaves comedy and social commentary to cleverly undercut stereotypes of her culture. In this uproarious talk\/stand-up hybrid, Farsad speaks on her documentary, The Muslims Are Coming!, narrates her fight with the MTA in New York and offers a detailed breakdown of the different types of haters she's encountered in her work. \"Comedy is one of our best weapons,\" she says. \"We've tried a lot of approaches to social justice, like war and competitive ice dancing -- but a lot of things are still kind of awful. I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.\"","slug":"negin_farsad_a_highly_scientific_taxonomy_of_haters","recorded_at":"2016-02-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-06-10
