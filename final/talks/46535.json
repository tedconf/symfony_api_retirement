{"talk":{"id":46535,"name":"Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff: How we can make racism a solvable problem -- and improve policing","description":"When we define racism as behaviors instead of feelings, we can measure it -- and transform it from an impossible problem into a solvable one, says justice scientist Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff. In an actionable talk, he shares his work at the Center for Policing Equity, an organization that helps police departments diagnose and track racial gaps in policing in order to eliminate them. Learn more about their data-driven approach -- and how you can get involved with the work that still needs to be done. (This ambitious plan is part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change.)","slug":"dr_phillip_atiba_goff_how_we_can_make_racism_a_solvable_problem_and_improve_policing","recorded_at":"2019-04-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2019-09-09 14:50:49","updated_at":"2021-12-10 17:53:06","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":597,"name":"TED2019"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1533b992b244f424286c5494228e211d1df58f3_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1533b992b244f424286c5494228e211d1df58f3_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1533b992b244f424286c5494228e211d1df58f3_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1533b992b244f424286c5494228e211d1df58f3_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/41ace1cef678ec844daf7833c0e008bb84d3b7ce_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6056542,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":16761766,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":29686343,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41844921,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":55990912,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87789260,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":135826478,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6270664,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42010900,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87925999,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7520181,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17017802,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/PhillipAtibaGoff_2019-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":87920275,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"el":{"name":"Greek"},"gu":{"name":"Gujarati"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Audacious Project"},{"tag":"United States"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"crime"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"data"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"justice system"},{"tag":"race"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"},{"tag":"violence"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5093,"name":"Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff"}}],"ratings":[]}}
