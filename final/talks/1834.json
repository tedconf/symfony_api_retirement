{"talk":{"id":1834,"name":"Fabian Oefner: Psychedelic science","description":"Swiss artist and photographer Fabian Oefner is on a mission to make eye-catching art from everyday science. In this charming talk, he shows off some recent psychedelic images, including photographs of crystals as they interact with soundwaves. And, in a live demo, he shows what really happens when you mix paint with magnetic liquid--or when you set fire to whiskey.","slug":"fabian_oefner_psychedelic_science","recorded_at":"2013-06-12
