{"talk":{"id":59980,"name":"France Villarta: The gender-fluid history of the Philippines","description":"In much of the world, gender is viewed as binary: man or woman, each assigned characteristics and traits designated by biological sex. But that's not the case everywhere, says France Villarta. In a talk that's part cultural love letter, part history lesson, he details the legacy of gender fluidity and inclusivity in his native Philippines -- and emphasizes the universal beauty of all people, regardless of society's labels.","slug":"france_villarta_the_gender_fluid_history_of_the_philippines","recorded_at":"2020-02-05 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-03-09 15:01:16","updated_at":"2021-04-13 21:31:50","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":625,"name":"TED@WellsFargo"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/738224e46aabb7b027ea329f91d227085c1919cf_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/738224e46aabb7b027ea329f91d227085c1919cf_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/738224e46aabb7b027ea329f91d227085c1919cf_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/738224e46aabb7b027ea329f91d227085c1919cf_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/987c2f15b89bd54b7d8145436f776eb743436cff_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5366219,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14861014,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26318423,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37109986,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49724304,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77971131,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":120510960,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5580426,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37275910,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":78107500,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6612691,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15116838,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/FranceVillarta_2020S-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":78107990,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"ca":{"name":"Catalan"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"gl":{"name":"Galician"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pl":{"name":"Polish"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"sv":{"name":"Swedish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"LGBTQIA+"},{"tag":"Transgender"},{"tag":"culture"},{"tag":"gender"},{"tag":"history"},{"tag":"social change"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":5765,"name":"France Villarta"}}],"ratings":[]}}
