In this bright, uplifting talk, Ajayi Jones shares three questions to ask yourself if you're teetering on the edge of speaking up or quieting down -- and encourages all of us to get a little more comfortable with being uncomfortable.","slug":"luvvie_ajayi_jones_get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-12-01
