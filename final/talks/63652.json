{"talk":{"id":63652,"name":"Uri Alon: A COVID-19 \"exit\" strategy to end lockdown and reopen the economy","description":"How can we return to work without spurring a second surge of coronavirus infection? Biologist Uri Alon shares a thought-provoking strategy: four days at work followed by 10 days of lockdown, a cycle that would exploit a weakness in the virus's biology and potentially cut its reproductive rate to a manageable level. Learn more about this approach -- which has already been adopted by both companies and countries -- and how it could be a key to reopening the economy responsibly. (This virtual conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson and science curator David Biello, was recorded on May 20, 2020.)","slug":"uri_alon_a_covid_19_exit_strategy_to_end_lockdown_and_reopen_the_economy","recorded_at":"2020-05-20 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-05-26 19:10:19","updated_at":"2020-12-24 13:59:07","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":644,"name":"TED2020 "},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6fd9bad214057f7c6b5747b908695dd51a2defde_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6fd9bad214057f7c6b5747b908695dd51a2defde_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6fd9bad214057f7c6b5747b908695dd51a2defde_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/6fd9bad214057f7c6b5747b908695dd51a2defde_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/89eb227b9c1ddbf58d7713a9a880f325e4f7261f_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7811671,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21677792,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":38327327,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":53871150,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":71824972,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111686323,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":173701173,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8069773,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":54390246,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111963101,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7740122,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21945401,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/UriAlon_2020-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":111932194,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"bg":{"name":"Bulgarian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"he":{"name":"Hebrew"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"id":{"name":"Indonesian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"mr":{"name":"Marathi"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"coronavirus"},{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"pandemic"},{"tag":"virus"},{"tag":"work"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":1615,"name":"Uri Alon"}},{"speaker":{"id":187,"name":"Chris Anderson"}},{"speaker":{"id":4697,"name":"David Biello"}}],"ratings":[]}}
