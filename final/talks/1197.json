{"talk":{"id":1197,"name":"Geoffrey West: The surprising math of cities and corporations","description":"Physicist Geoffrey West has found that simple, mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth, crime rate, walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number: the city's population. In this mind-bending talk from TEDGlobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations.","slug":"geoffrey_west_the_surprising_math_of_cities_and_corporations","recorded_at":"2011-07-12 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-07-26 14:32:00","updated_at":"2021-04-09
