{"talk":{"id":2901,"name":"Eric Dyer: The forgotten art of the zoetrope","description":"Artist Eric Dyer spent years working at a computer to produce images for the screen. Longing to get his hands back on his work, he began exploring the zoetrope, a popular 19th-century device that was used to create the illusion of motion long before the arrival of film. In this vibrant talk, he showcases his resulting art inventions: spinning sculptures and that evoke beautiful, dreamlike scenes. (Warning: This talk includes flashing images and lights. Those who are photosensitive or have seizures trigged by strobes are advised to avoid.)","slug":"eric_dyer_the_forgotten_art_of_the_zoetrope","recorded_at":"2016-11-11 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-10-10 20:00:52","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:37:00","viewed_count":1039346,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":466,"name":"TEDxCharlottesville"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fb7651c33e4e47b715983af2d34e9e1ad16dd665_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fb7651c33e4e47b715983af2d34e9e1ad16dd665_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fb7651c33e4e47b715983af2d34e9e1ad16dd665_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fb7651c33e4e47b715983af2d34e9e1ad16dd665_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/0e8ddc459e940359e6953c82028f5e0bf0665a06_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4321833,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":11926867,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":21089708,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":29690380,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":39643594,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62710777,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":96540836,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":4580779,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":30209267,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62969120,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5321190,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":12181498,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/EricDyer_2016X-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":62977338,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"my":{"name":"Burmese"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"hr":{"name":"Croatian"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sr":{"name":"Serbian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"TEDx"},{"tag":"animation"},{"tag":"art"},{"tag":"creativity"},{"tag":"film"},{"tag":"illusion"},{"tag":"visualizations"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3674,"name":"Eric Dyer"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":40}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":18}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":29}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":28}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":8}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":4}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":8}}]}}
