{"talk":{"id":8417,"name":"Soyapi Mumba: Medical tech designed to meet Africa's needs","description":"In sub-Saharan Africa, power outages, low technology penetration, slow internet and understaffed hospitals plague health care systems. To make progress on these problems in Malawi, TED Fellow Soyapi Mumba and his team created a new system from scratch -- from the software that powers their electronic health records to the infrastructure used to support it. In this quick, hopeful talk, Mumba shares how his jack-of-all-trades mindset can help reshape health care in low-resource environments.","slug":"soyapi_mumba_medical_tech_designed_to_meet_africa_s_needs","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-01-09 21:00:09","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:38:14","viewed_count":1009227,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":465,"name":"TEDGlobal 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/05082a5f5a20b1d35f4028769b567791705cb9c7_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/05082a5f5a20b1d35f4028769b567791705cb9c7_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/05082a5f5a20b1d35f4028769b567791705cb9c7_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/05082a5f5a20b1d35f4028769b567791705cb9c7_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/634cb045603fde9b6e3f35e626b6d25a501bfdca_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":2879718,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7894646,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14073636,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":19913968,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26792071,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":41710340,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":63842273,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":3144837,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":20270064,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42271050,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8161496,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/SoyapiMumba_2017G-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42279054,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ro":{"name":"Romanian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"sl":{"name":"Slovenian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"ta":{"name":"Tamil"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"AIDS"},{"tag":"Africa"},{"tag":"Internet"},{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"health"},{"tag":"health care"},{"tag":"medicine"},{"tag":"software"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3591,"name":"Soyapi Mumba"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":65}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":102}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":43}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":30}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":21}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":10}}]}}
