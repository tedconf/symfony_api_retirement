{"talk":{"id":1847,"name":"Amanda Bennett: We need a heroic narrative for death","description":"Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days, too. Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of \"denial.\" She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life.","slug":"amanda_bennett_we_need_a_heroic_narrative_for_death","recorded_at":"2013-04-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2013-10-15
