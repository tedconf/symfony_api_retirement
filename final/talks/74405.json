{"talk":{"id":74405,"name":"Bill Gates: The innovations we need to avoid a climate disaster","description":"The single most important thing for avoiding a climate disaster is cutting carbon pollution from the current 51 billion tons per year to zero, says philanthropist and technologist Bill Gates. Introducing the concept of the \"green premium\" -- the higher price of zero-emission products like electric cars, artificial meat or sustainable aviation fuel -- Gates identifies the breakthroughs and investments we need to reduce the cost of clean tech, decarbonize the economy and create a pathway to a clean and prosperous future for all. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED Global curator Bruno Giussani, was recorded in March 2021.)","slug":"bill_gates_the_innovations_we_need_to_avoid_a_climate_disaster","recorded_at":"2021-03-22 00:00:00","published_at":"2021-03-22 11:51:31","updated_at":"2021-09-08 23:52:55","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":620,"name":"Countdown"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8f883e666ece486c405d7d8d7ad64269236d03d_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8f883e666ece486c405d7d8d7ad64269236d03d_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8f883e666ece486c405d7d8d7ad64269236d03d_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c8f883e666ece486c405d7d8d7ad64269236d03d_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/a0841e58e6a124fe47eee87520470a19c71d25ed_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":23759697,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":66169906,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":116915587,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":164089269,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":218552322,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":337272972,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":528997282,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24017152,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":164607695,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":337549635,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":28237375,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":66419534,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/BillGates_2021T-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":337548496,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"climate change"},{"tag":"economics"},{"tag":"energy"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"leadership"},{"tag":"renewable energy"},{"tag":"sustainability"},{"tag":"technology"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":339,"name":"Bill Gates"}},{"speaker":{"id":2051,"name":"Bruno Giussani"}}],"ratings":[]}}
