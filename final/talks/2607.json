{"talk":{"id":2607,"name":"Manwar Ali: Inside the mind of a former radical jihadist","description":"\"For a long time, I lived for death,\" says Manwar Ali, a former radical jihadist who participated in violent, armed campaigns in the Middle East and Asia in the 1980s. In this moving talk, he reflects on his experience with radicalization and makes a powerful, direct appeal to anyone drawn to Islamist groups that claim violence and brutality are noble and virtuous: let go of anger and hatred, he says, and instead cultivate your heart to see goodness, beauty and truth in others.","slug":"manwar_ali_inside_the_mind_of_a_former_radical_jihadist","recorded_at":"2016-04-15 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-10-20 15:17:43","updated_at":"2020-09-28
