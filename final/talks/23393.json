{"talk":{"id":23393,"name":"Camille A. Brown: \"New Second Line\"","description":"Inspired by the events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, TED Fellow Camille A. Brown choreographed \"New Second Line,\" a celebration of the culture of New Orleans and the perseverance of Black people in the midst of devastation. The performance borrows its name from the energetic, spirited people who follow the traditional brass band parades for weddings, social events and, most notably, funerals in New Orleans. \"It honors our ability to rise and keep rising,\" Brown says. (Music includes \"New Second Line\" by Los Hombres Calientes featuring Kermit Ruffins)","slug":"camille_a_brown_new_second_line","recorded_at":"2018-04-10 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-10-05 12:43:31","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:35:02","viewed_count":170166,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":494,"name":"TED2018"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1b5607082f715e5c16dc30c6b9cc075e5ff2cea_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1b5607082f715e5c16dc30c6b9cc075e5ff2cea_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1b5607082f715e5c16dc30c6b9cc075e5ff2cea_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d1b5607082f715e5c16dc30c6b9cc075e5ff2cea_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/fbd0b9ff179f13ed368f8c319a39a1a0b9968317_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5016264,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":13888173,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24595996,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34686685,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":46483313,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":72870263,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":112584244,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5230377,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":34852665,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/CamilleABrown_2018-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":73006890,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"tags":[{"tag":"TED Fellows"},{"tag":"art"},{"tag":"dance"},{"tag":"entertainment"},{"tag":"music"},{"tag":"performance"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":2493,"name":"Camille A.
