{"talk":{"id":1019,"name":"Bart Weetjens: How I taught rats to sniff out land mines","description":"No one knows exactly how many landmines still litter the world, but it's safe to say: millions, waiting to kill and maim unsuspecting civilians. Clearing them is slow, expensive and dangerous. The founder of Apopo, Bart Weetjens, talks about his extraordinary project: training rats to sniff out land mines. He shows clips of his \"hero rats\" in action, and previews his work's next phase: teaching them to turn up tuberculosis in the lab.","slug":"bart_weetjens_how_i_taught_rats_to_sniff_out_land_mines","recorded_at":"2010-06-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2010-12-02 15:25:00","updated_at":"2021-01-07
