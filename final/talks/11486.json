{"talk":{"id":11486,"name":"Deanna Van Buren: What a world without prisons could look like","description":"Deanna Van Buren designs restorative justice centers that, instead of taking the punitive approach used by a system focused on mass incarceration, treat crime as a breach of relationships and justice as a process where all stakeholders come together to repair that breach. With help and ideas from incarcerated men and women, Van Buren is creating dynamic spaces that provide safe venues for dialogue and reconciliation; employment and job training; and social services to help keep people from entering the justice system in the first place. \"Imagine a world without prisons,\" Van Buren says. \"And join me in creating all the things that we could build instead.\"","slug":"deanna_van_buren_what_a_world_without_prisons_could_look_like","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-13 15:00:27","updated_at":"2021-10-22
