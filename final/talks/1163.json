{"talk":{"id":1163,"name":"Jack Horner: Building a dinosaur from a chicken","description":"Renowned paleontologist Jack Horner has spent his career trying to reconstruct a dinosaur. He's found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues, but never intact DNA. So, in a new approach, he's taking living descendants of the dinosaur (chickens) and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits \u2014 including teeth, tails, and even hands \u2014 to make a \"Chickenosaurus\".","slug":"jack_horner_building_a_dinosaur_from_a_chicken","recorded_at":"2011-03-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2011-06-07 00:00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28
