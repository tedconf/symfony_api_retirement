{"talk":{"id":2546,"name":"Shubhendu Sharma: How to grow a forest in your backyard","description":"Forests don't have to be far-flung nature reserves, isolated from human life. Instead, we can grow them right where we are -- even in cities. Eco-entrepreneur and TED Fellow Shubhendu Sharma grows ultra-dense, biodiverse mini-forests of native species in urban areas by engineering soil, microbes and biomass to kickstart natural growth processes. Follow along as he describes how to grow a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years, and learn how you can get in on this tiny jungle party.","slug":"shubhendu_sharma_how_to_grow_a_forest_in_your_backyard","recorded_at":"2016-05-18 00:00:00","published_at":"2016-07-14 14:42:42","updated_at":"2021-04-09
