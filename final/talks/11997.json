{"talk":{"id":11997,"name":"Adong Judith: How I use art to bridge misunderstanding","description":"Director and playwright Adong Judith creates provocative art that sparks dialogue on issues from LGBTQ rights to war crimes. In this quick but powerful talk, the TED Fellow details her work -- including the play \"Silent Voices,\" which brought victims of the Northern Ugandan war against Joseph Kony's rebel group together with political, religious and cultural leaders for transformative talks. \"Listening to one another will not magically solve all problems,\" Judith says. \"But it will give a chance to create avenues to start to work together to solve many of humanity's problems.\"","slug":"adong_judith_how_i_use_art_to_bridge_misunderstanding","recorded_at":"2017-08-27 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-03-19
