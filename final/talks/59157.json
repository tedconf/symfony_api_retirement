{"talk":{"id":59157,"name":"Robin Steinberg and Manoush Zomorodi: The US is addicted to incarceration. Here's how to break the cycle","description":"Nearly half a million people in the US are in jail right now without being convicted of a crime, simply because they can't come up with the money to pay cash bail. To try and fix this system, public defender and activist Robin Steinberg asked a straightforward question: What if we paid bail for them? In conversation with TED Radio Hour host Manoush Zomorodi, Steinberg shares how her nonprofit The Bail Project -- which uses a revolving fund to post bail for those who can't afford it -- is scaling up their efforts across the country and rolling out a new community-based model to fight mass incarceration. (This ambitious plan is part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change.)","slug":"robin_steinberg_and_manoush_zomorodi_the_us_is_addicted_to_incarceration_here_s_how_to_break_the_cycle","recorded_at":"2019-12-04 00:00:00","published_at":"2020-05-12 14:54:27","updated_at":"2021-11-02 16:07:25","viewed_count":0,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":618,"name":"TEDWomen 2019"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/98149d545f5f8abcdca973e72f438ce16613804d_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/98149d545f5f8abcdca973e72f438ce16613804d_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/98149d545f5f8abcdca973e72f438ce16613804d_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/98149d545f5f8abcdca973e72f438ce16613804d_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/2b35d2c0711baf42368617d5eb88550e40da49f6_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8694357,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24133325,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":42712229,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":60118606,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":80339168,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":126241531,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":195801186,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":8908586,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":60284684,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":126378200,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":10908266,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":24385843,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RobinSteinberg_2019W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":126379234,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"th":{"name":"Thai"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Audacious Project"},{"tag":"United States"},{"tag":"activism"},{"tag":"community"},{"tag":"crime"},{"tag":"equality"},{"tag":"justice system"},{"tag":"law"},{"tag":"prison"},{"tag":"social change"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3973,"name":"Robin Steinberg"}},{"speaker":{"id":3400,"name":"Manoush Zomorodi"}}],"ratings":[]}}
