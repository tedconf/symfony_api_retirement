{"talk":{"id":2650,"name":"Erika Gregory: The world doesn't need more nuclear weapons","description":"Today nine nations collectively control more than 15,000 nuclear weapons, each hundreds of times more powerful than those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We don't need more nuclear weapons; we need a new generation to face the unfinished challenge of disarmament started decades ago. Nuclear reformer Erika Gregory calls on today's rising leaders -- those born in a time without Cold War fears and duck-and-cover training -- to pursue an ambitious goal: ridding the world of nuclear weapons by 2045.","slug":"erika_gregory_the_world_doesn_t_need_more_nuclear_weapons","recorded_at":"2016-10-28 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-01-04 16:10:26","updated_at":"2021-04-09
