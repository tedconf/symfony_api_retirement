{"talk":{"id":2870,"name":"Radhika Nagpal: What intelligent machines can learn from a school of fish","description":"Science fiction visions of the future show us AI built to replicate our way of thinking -- but what if we modeled it instead on the other kinds of intelligence found in nature? Robotics engineer Radhika Nagpal studies the collective intelligence displayed by insects and fish schools, seeking to understand their rules of engagement. In a visionary talk, she presents her work creating artificial collective power and previews a future where swarms of robots work together to build flood barriers, pollinate crops, monitor coral reefs and form constellations of satellites.","slug":"radhika_nagpal_what_intelligent_machines_can_learn_from_a_school_of_fish","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-09-21 15:01:35","updated_at":"2021-04-09 19:47:08","viewed_count":1230217,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":455,"name":"TED2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95988aa4a11b84ffeab289b006b87205066a56e9_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95988aa4a11b84ffeab289b006b87205066a56e9_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95988aa4a11b84ffeab289b006b87205066a56e9_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/95988aa4a11b84ffeab289b006b87205066a56e9_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/c53141c36afbe2f6e492e97f70393e3860ad8efb_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5366144,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":14846606,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":26318944,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37117221,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":49717975,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":77987750,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":120589347,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":5580348,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":37283151,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":78124511,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6572716,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":15104394,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/RadhikaNagpal_2017-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":78126787,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"},"uk":{"name":"Ukrainian"},"vi":{"name":"Vietnamese"}},"tags":[{"tag":"AI"},{"tag":"fish"},{"tag":"future"},{"tag":"innovation"},{"tag":"insects"},{"tag":"robots"},{"tag":"science"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3326,"name":"Radhika Nagpal"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":50}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":100}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":75}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":89}},{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":9}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":100}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":2}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":14}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":20}},{"rating":{"id":7,"name":"Funny","count":7}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":12}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":7}}]}}
