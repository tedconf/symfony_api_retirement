{"talk":{"id":2817,"name":"Anil Seth: Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality","description":"Right now, billions of neurons in your brain are working together to generate a conscious experience -- and not just any conscious experience, your experience of the world around you and of yourself within it. How does this happen? According to neuroscientist Anil Seth, we're all hallucinating all the time; when we agree about our hallucinations, we call it \"reality.\" Join Seth for a delightfully disorienting talk that may leave you questioning the very nature of your existence.","slug":"anil_seth_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality","recorded_at":"2017-04-24 00:00:00","published_at":"2017-07-18
