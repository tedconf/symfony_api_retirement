{"talk":{"id":13834,"name":"Clemantine Wamariya: War and what comes after","description":"Clemantine Wamariya was six years old when the Rwandan Civil War forced her and her sister to flee their home in Kigali, leaving their parents and everything they knew behind. In this deeply personal talk, she tells the story of how she became a refugee, living in camps in seven countries over the next six years -- and how she's tried to make sense of what came after.","slug":"clemantine_wamariya_war_and_what_comes_after","recorded_at":"2017-11-01 00:00:00","published_at":"2018-04-24 14:55:14","updated_at":"2020-09-28 21:44:19","viewed_count":1015785,"emailed_count":0,"event":{"id":471,"name":"TEDWomen 2017"},"images":[{"image":{"size":"113x85","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d75ecc73efc06aaf3620570ec1e9fb37804489bf_113x85.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"240x180","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d75ecc73efc06aaf3620570ec1e9fb37804489bf_240x180.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"615x461","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d75ecc73efc06aaf3620570ec1e9fb37804489bf_615x461.jpg"}},{"image":{"size":"2400x1800","url":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/d75ecc73efc06aaf3620570ec1e9fb37804489bf_2400x1800.jpg"}}],"image_16x9":"https:\/\/pe.tedcdn.com\/images\/ted\/900606ae51951b2e5c0ad488d82e4e77c3570005_2880x1620.jpg","media":{"internal":{"64k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-64k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6297715,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"180k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-180k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17426794,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"320k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-320k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":30850289,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"450k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-450k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43481595,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"600k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-600k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":58191139,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"950k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-950k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":91281529,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"1500k":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-1500k.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":141324877,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-light":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-light.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":6512001,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-regular":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":43647505,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-480p.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":91418153,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"audio-podcast":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W.mp3?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":7688678,"mime_type":"audio\/mp3"},"podcast-low-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-low-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":17681571,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"},"podcast-high-en":{"uri":"https:\/\/download.ted.com\/talks\/ClemantineWamariya_2017W-480p-en.mp4?apikey=c692baa7dafbf74e4fbde1ac88b44cafc96cfe7a","filesize_bytes":91421193,"mime_type":"video\/mp4"}}},"languages":{"ar":{"name":"Arabic"},"be":{"name":"Belarusian"},"zh-cn":{"name":"Chinese, Simplified"},"zh-tw":{"name":"Chinese, Traditional"},"nl":{"name":"Dutch"},"en":{"name":"English","native":true},"fr":{"name":"French"},"de":{"name":"German"},"hu":{"name":"Hungarian"},"it":{"name":"Italian"},"ja":{"name":"Japanese"},"ko":{"name":"Korean"},"ku":{"name":"Kurdish"},"fa":{"name":"Persian"},"pt":{"name":"Portuguese"},"pt-br":{"name":"Portuguese, Brazilian"},"ru":{"name":"Russian"},"es":{"name":"Spanish"},"tr":{"name":"Turkish"}},"tags":[{"tag":"Africa"},{"tag":"family"},{"tag":"humanity"},{"tag":"refugees"},{"tag":"society"}],"themes":[],"speakers":[{"speaker":{"id":3619,"name":"Clemantine Wamariya"}}],"ratings":[{"rating":{"id":3,"name":"Courageous","count":74}},{"rating":{"id":8,"name":"Informative","count":32}},{"rating":{"id":10,"name":"Inspiring","count":56}},{"rating":{"id":24,"name":"Persuasive","count":23}},{"rating":{"id":21,"name":"Unconvincing","count":10}},{"rating":{"id":22,"name":"Fascinating","count":6}},{"rating":{"id":1,"name":"Beautiful","count":17}},{"rating":{"id":26,"name":"Obnoxious","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":23,"name":"Jaw-dropping","count":11}},{"rating":{"id":2,"name":"Confusing","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":11,"name":"Longwinded","count":1}},{"rating":{"id":25,"name":"OK","count":3}},{"rating":{"id":9,"name":"Ingenious","count":1}}]}}
